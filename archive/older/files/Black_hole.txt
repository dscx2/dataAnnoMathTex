Objects whose [[gravitational field]]s are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by [[John Michell]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].<ref name=origin /> The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by [[David Finkelstein]] in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of [[neutron star]]s by [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] in 1967 sparked interest in [[gravitational collapse|gravitationally collapsed]] compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.

Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]].

The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other [[matter]] and with [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external [[accretion disk]] heated by friction, forming some of the [[Quasar|brightest objects in the universe]]. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed."<ref name="pmid32001633">{{cite journal | author=Clery D | title=Black holes caught in the act of swallowing stars | journal=[[Science (journal)|SCIENCE]] | volume=367 | issue=6477 | pages=495 | year=2020 | doi = 10.1126/science.367.6477.495 | pmid=32001633}}</ref> If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location.

The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by astronomical pioneer and English clergyman [[John Michell]] in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and the surface [[escape velocity]] exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Michell |first=J. |authorlink1=John Michell |date=1784 |title=On the Means of Discovering the Distance, Magnitude, &c. of the Fixed Stars, in Consequence of the Diminution of the Velocity of Their Light, in Case Such a Diminution Should be Found to Take Place in any of Them, and Such Other Data Should be Procured from Observations, as Would be Farther Necessary for That Purpose.

In 1915, [[Albert Einstein]] developed his theory of [[general relativity]], having earlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found a [[Schwarzschild metric|solution]] to the [[Einstein field equations]], which describes the [[gravitational field]] of a [[point mass]] and a spherical mass.<ref name="Schwarzschild1916">{{Cite journal |last=Schwarzschild |first=K. |authorlink1=Karl Schwarzschild |date=1916 |title=Über das Gravitationsfeld eines Massenpunktes nach der Einsteinschen Theorie |url=https://archive.org/stream/sitzungsberichte1916deutsch#page/188/mode/2up |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften |volume=7 |pages=189–196 |ref=harv|bibcode=1916SPAW.......189S }}

Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called "frozen stars", because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it to the Schwarzschild radius.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ruffini |first=R. |authorlink1=Remo Ruffini |last2=Wheeler |first2=J.

==== Golden age ====
In 1958, [[David Finkelstein]] identified the Schwarzschild surface as an [[event horizon]], "a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=D. |authorlink1=David Finkelstein |date=1958 |title=Past-Future Asymmetry of the Gravitational Field of a Point Particle |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=965–967 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.110.965 |ref=harv |bibcode=1958PhRv..110..965F}}</ref> This did not strictly contradict Oppenheimer's results, but extended them to include the point of view of infalling observers. [[Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates|Finkelstein's solution]] extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole.

These results came at the beginning of the [[golden age of general relativity]], which was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was helped by the discovery of [[pulsar]]s by [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] in 1967,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hewish |first1=A. |authorlink1=Antony Hewish |last2=Bell |first2=S.

In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, [[Roy Kerr]] found [[Kerr metric|the exact solution]] for a [[rotating black hole]]. Two years later, [[Ezra T.

At first, it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed, and that the singularities would not appear in generic situations. This view was held in particular by [[Vladimir A.

=== Etymology ===
John Michell used the term "dark star",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/27/mapping-the-heavens-natarajan-black-holes/ |title=Mapping the Heavens: How Cosmology Shaped Our Understanding of the Universe and the Strange Story of How the Term "Black Hole" Was Born |first=Maria |last=Popova |date=27 June 2016 |website=brainpickings.org |accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> and in the early 20th century, physicists used the term "gravitationally collapsed object". Science writer Marcia Bartusiak traces the term "black hole" to physicist [[Robert H. Dicke]], who in the early 1960s reportedly compared the phenomenon to the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]], notorious as a prison where people entered but never left alive.<ref name=Bartusiak>{{cite web |url=https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2018/10/09/marcia-bartusiak-planet-three |title=MIT's Marcia Bartusiak On Understanding Our Place In The Universe |website=www.wbur.org |accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref>

The term "black hole" was used in print by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Science News]]'' magazines in 1963,<ref name=Bartusiak /> and by science journalist Ann Ewing in her article {{" '}}Black Holes' in Space", dated 18 January 1964, which was a report on a meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] held in Cleveland, Ohio.<ref name="scinewsewing">{{cite web |last1=Siegfried |first1=Tom |title=50 years later, it's hard to say who named black holes |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/50-years-later-it%E2%80%99s-hard-say-who-named-black-holes |work=Science News |accessdate=24 September 2017 |date=23 December 2013 |quote=It seems that the "black hole" label was also bandied about in January 1964 in Cleveland at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

== Properties and structure ==
[[File:Black hole details.svg|thumb|Simple illustration of a non-spinning black hole]]

The [[no-hair theorem|no-hair conjecture]] postulates that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: [[mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and [[angular momentum]]; the black hole is otherwise featureless. If the conjecture is true, any two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable from one another. The degree to which the conjecture is true for real black holes under the laws of modern physics, is currently an unsolved problem.<ref name="HeuslerNoHair">{{Cite journal |last=Heusler |first=M. |date=2012 |title=Stationary Black Holes: Uniqueness and Beyond |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=7 |ref=harv |doi=10.12942/lrr-2012-7 |pmid=28179837 |pmc=5255892 |arxiv=1205.6112 |bibcode=2012LRR....15....7C}}</ref>

These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of [[Gauss's law]], the [[ADM mass]], far away from the black hole.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=253}}</ref>{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Likewise, the angular momentum can be measured from far away using [[frame dragging]] by the [[gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]].{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

When an object falls into a black hole, any [[physical information|information]] about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers. The behavior of the horizon in this situation is a [[dissipative system]] that is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and [[electrical resistance]]—the [[membrane paradigm]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black holes: the membrane paradigm |last1=Thorne |first1=K.

Price |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-300-03770-8}}</ref> This is different from other [[field theory (physics)|field theories]] such as electromagnetism, which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic level, because they are [[T-symmetry|time-reversible]]. Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in. The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon, including [[Conservation law (physics)|approximately conserved]] [[quantum number]]s such as the total [[baryon number]] and [[lepton number]]. This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the [[black hole information loss paradox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/info_loss.html |title=The Black Hole Information Loss Problem |website=Usenet Physics FAQ |last=Anderson |first=Warren G. |date=1996 |accessdate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122223839/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/info_loss.html |archivedate=22 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last=Preskill |first=J. |authorlink1=John Preskill |url=http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/talks/blackholes.pdf |title=Black holes and information: A crisis in quantum physics |date=21 October 1994 |conference=Caltech Theory Seminar |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518054438/http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/talks/blackholes.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2008 }}</ref>

=== Physical properties ===
The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum. These black holes are often referred to as [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black holes]] after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution]] in 1916.<ref name="Schwarzschild1916" /> According to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], it is the only [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] that is [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherically symmetric]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=Appendix B}}</ref> This means there is no observable difference at a distance between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass. The popular notion of a black hole "sucking in everything" in its surroundings is therefore correct only near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Michael A. |last1=Seeds |first2=Dana E. |last2=Backman |title=Perspectives on Astronomy |page=167 |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-495-11352-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXom04KGIL8C&pg=PA167 |ref=harv |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810211808/https://books.google.com/books?id=CXom04KGIL8C&pg=PA167 |archivedate=10 August 2016}}</ref>

Solutions describing more general black holes also exist. Non-rotating [[charged black hole]]s are described by the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]], while the [[Kerr metric]] describes a non-charged [[rotating black hole]]. The most general [[stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole solution known is the [[Kerr–Newman metric]], which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum.<ref name=shapiro_teukolsky1983>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=S.

While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass. In [[Planck units]], the total electric charge&nbsp;''Q'' and the total angular momentum&nbsp;''J'' are expected to satisfy

:<math>Q^2+\left ( \tfrac{J}{M} \right )^2\le M^2\, </math>

for a black hole of mass ''M''. Black holes with the minimum possible mass satisfying this inequality are called [[extremal black hole|extremal]]. Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event horizon. These solutions have so-called [[naked singularity|naked singularities]] that can be observed from the outside, and hence are deemed ''unphysical''. The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are created through the gravitational collapse of [[energy conditions|realistic matter]].<ref name="wald 1997" /> This is supported by numerical simulations.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Berger |first=B. K. |date=2002 |title=Numerical Approaches to Spacetime Singularities |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=2002–1 |ref=harv |bibcode=2002LRR.....5....1B |doi=10.12942/lrr-2002-1 |pmid=28179859 |pmc=5256073 |arxiv=gr-qc/0201056}}</ref>

Due to the relatively large strength of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star.

The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in [[spacetime]] through which matter and light can pass only inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler|2007|p=179}}</ref>

As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 5.4 and 7.3}}</ref> At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that<!--to avoid false positives in search for 'that led/lead' typo--> lead away from the black hole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Singularities and Black Holes > Lightcones and Causal Structure |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/lightcone.html |website=plato.stanford.edu |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>

On the other hand, indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of these effects as they cross the event horizon. According to their own clocks, which appear to them to tick normally, they cross the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour; in classical general relativity, it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations, due to Einstein's [[equivalence principle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=222}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Watch: Three Ways an Astronaut Could Fall Into a Black Hole |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140130-black-holes-stephen-hawking-work-space-astronomy/ |accessdate=13 March 2018 |date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

=== Singularity ===
{{Main|Gravitational singularity}}

At the center of a black hole, as described by general relativity, may lie a [[gravitational singularity]], a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=205}}</ref> For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point and for a [[rotating black hole]], it is smeared out to form a [[ring singularity]] that lies in the plane of rotation.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=264–265}}</ref> In both cases, the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=252}}</ref> The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite [[mass density|density]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sizes of Black Holes?

Observers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole (''i.e.'', non-rotating and not charged) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity, once they cross the event horizon. They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a limit.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lewis |first=G.

In the case of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole, it is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a [[wormhole]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=257–259 and 265–266}}</ref> The possibility of traveling to another universe is, however, only theoretical since any perturbation would destroy this possibility.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Black holes: the inside story |first1=S. |last1=Droz |first2=W. |last2=Israel |first3=S.

The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Wald|1984|p=212}}</ref> This breakdown, however, is expected; it occurs in a situation where [[quantum effects]] should describe these actions, due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions.

=== Photon sphere ===
{{Main|Photon sphere}}

The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which [[photon]]s that move on [[tangent]]s to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit about the black hole. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. Their orbits would be [[instability|dynamically unstable]], hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon.<ref name=prd84_6>{{Cite journal |last1=Nitta |first1=Daisuke |last2=Chiba |first2=Takeshi |last3=Sugiyama |first3=Naoshi |title=Shadows of colliding black holes |journal=Physical Review D |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=063008 |date=September 2011 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.84.063008 |bibcode=2011PhRvD..84f3008N |arxiv=1106.2425 |ref=harv}}</ref>

While light can still escape from the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon.<ref name=prd84_6 />

=== Ergosphere ===
{{Main|Ergosphere}}
[[File:Ergosphere and event horizon of a rotating black hole (no animation).gif|thumb|The ergosphere is a pumpkin-shaped region outside of the event horizon, where objects cannot remain stationary.<ref name=viss>{{cite arxiv |eprint=0706.0622 |last1=Visser |first1=Matt |title=The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction |class=gr-qc |year=2007}}, page [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0622v3.pdf#35 35], Fig. 3</ref>]]

Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a process known as [[frame-dragging]]; general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly "drag" along the spacetime immediately surrounding it. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect is so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 6.6}}</ref>

The ergosphere of a black hole is a volume whose inner boundary is the black hole's [[oblate spheroid]] event horizon and a pumpkin-shaped outer boundary, which coincides with the event horizon at the poles but noticeably wider around the equator. The outer boundary is sometimes called the ''ergosurface''.<ref name=viss />

Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the [[Penrose process]], objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered. This energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole causing the latter to slow.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 6.7}}</ref> A variation of the Penrose process in the presence of strong magnetic fields, the [[Blandford–Znajek process]] is considered a likely mechanism for the enormous luminosity and relativistic jets of [[quasars]] and other [[active galactic nuclei]].

=== Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) ===
{{Main|Innermost stable circular orbit}}

In [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravity]], [[test particle]]s can stably orbit at arbitrary distances from a central object. In [[general relativity]], however, there exists an innermost stable circular orbit (often called the ISCO), inside of which, any infinitesimal perturbations to a circular orbit will lead to inspiral into the black hole.<ref>{{harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}</ref> The location of the ISCO depends on the spin of the black hole, in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole (spin zero) is:

:<math>r_{isco}=3 \, r_s=\frac{6 \, GM}{c^2}, </math>

and decreases with increasing black hole spin for particles orbiting in the same direction as the spin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bardeen |first1=J.

== Formation and evolution ==
Given the bizarre character of black holes, it was long questioned whether such objects could actually exist in nature or whether they were merely pathological solutions to Einstein's equations.

Penrose demonstrated that once an event horizon forms, general relativity without quantum mechanics requires that a singularity will form within.<ref name=penrose1965 /> Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions that describe the [[Big Bang]] have singularities without [[scalar field]]s or other [[exotic matter]] (see "[[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]]").{{clarify|date=February 2016}} The [[Kerr solution]], the [[no-hair theorem]], and the laws of [[black hole thermodynamics]] showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for research.<ref name=HawkingPenrose1970>{{Cite journal |first=S.

=== Gravitational collapse ===
{{Main|Gravitational collapse}}

Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal [[pressure]] is insufficient to resist the object's own gravity. For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little "fuel" left to maintain its temperature through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight.<ref name="Carroll5.8">{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Section 5.8}}</ref>
The collapse may be stopped by the [[degeneracy pressure]] of the star's constituents, allowing the condensation of matter into an exotic [[Degenerate matter|denser state]]. The result is one of the various types of [[compact star]]. Which type forms depends on the mass of the remnant of the original star left after the outer layers have been blown away. Such explosions and pulsations lead to [[planetary nebula]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Planetary Nebulae and How to Observe Them |edition=illustrated |first1=Martin |last1=Griffiths |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4614-1781-1 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2aURFWBI8EC |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203011053/https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2aURFWBI8EC |archivedate=3 December 2016}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2aURFWBI8EC&pg=PA11 Extract of page 11]</ref> This mass can be substantially less than the original star. Remnants exceeding {{Solar mass|5}} are produced by stars that were over {{Solar mass|20}} before the collapse.<ref name="Carroll5.8" />

If the mass of the remnant exceeds about {{Solar mass|3–4}} (the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]<ref name="OV1939" />), either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter, even the degeneracy pressure of [[neutrons]] is insufficient to stop the collapse. No known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure, see [[quark star]]) is powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole.<ref name="Carroll5.8" />

[[File:Artist’s impression of supermassive black hole seed.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of supermassive black hole seed<ref>{{cite web |title=Artist's impression of supermassive black hole seed |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1610a/ |accessdate=27 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530104735/http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1610a/ |archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>]]

The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of [[stellar mass black hole]]s. [[Star formation]] in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to {{Solar mass|10{{sup|3}}}}.

While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of infalling matter, a distant observer would see the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to [[gravitational time dilation]]. Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=R. |authorlink1=Roger Penrose |title=Gravitational Collapse: The Role of General Relativity |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=34 |issue=7 |page=1141 |date=2002 |doi=10.1023/A:1016578408204 |url=http://www.imamu.edu.sa/Scientific_selections/abstracts/Physics/Gravitational%20Collapse%20The%20Role%20of%20General.pdf |bibcode=2002GReGr..34.1141P |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526224126/http://www.imamu.edu.sa/Scientific_selections/abstracts/Physics/Gravitational%20Collapse%20The%20Role%20of%20General.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=}}</ref>

==== Primordial black holes and the Big Bang ====
Gravitational collapse requires great density. In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are found only in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the [[Big Bang]] densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. High density alone is not enough to allow black hole formation since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up. In order for [[primordial black holes]] to have formed in such a dense medium, there must have been initial density perturbations that could then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the scale of these fluctuations. Various models predict the creation of primordial black holes ranging in size from a [[Planck mass]] to hundreds of thousands of solar masses.<ref name="carr primordial">{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=B. J. |chapter=Primordial Black Holes: Do They Exist and Are They Useful? |editor1-first=H. |editor1-last=Suzuki |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Yokoyama |editor3-first=Y. |editor3-last=Suto |editor4-first=K. |editor4-last=Sato |title=Inflating Horizon of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology |pages=astro–ph/0511743 |publisher=Universal Academy Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-4-946443-94-7 |arxiv=astro-ph/0511743 |bibcode=2005astro.ph.11743C}}</ref>

Despite the early universe being extremely [[density|dense]]—far denser than is usually required to form a black hole—it did not re-collapse into a black hole during the Big Bang. Models for [[gravitational collapse]] of objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, do not necessarily apply in the same way to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Philip Gibbs |title=Is the Big Bang a black hole? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/universe.html |publisher=[[John Baez]] |accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>

=== High-energy collisions ===
[[File:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|Simulated event in the CMS detector: a collision in which a micro black hole may be created]]

Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle, black holes could be formed in [[high-energy physics|high-energy]] collisions that achieve sufficient density.

=== Growth ===
Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional [[matter]]. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and [[interstellar dust]] from its surroundings. This is the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem to have grown.<ref name="ReesVolonteri" /> A similar process has been suggested for the formation of [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s found in [[globular cluster]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=E. |last1=Vesperini |first2=S.

=== Evaporation ===
{{Main|Hawking radiation}}

In 1974, Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation at a temperature ℏ&nbsp;''c''{{sup|3}}/(8&nbsp;π&nbsp;''G''&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;[[Bolzmann constant|''k''{{sub|B}}]]);<ref name=Hawking1974>{{Cite journal |last=Hawking |first=S.

By applying [[quantum field theory]] to a static black hole background, he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect [[black body spectrum]]. Since Hawking's publication, many others have verified the result through various approaches.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Page |first=D.

Hence, large black holes emit less radiation than small black holes.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 9.6}}</ref>

If a black hole is very small, the radiation effects are expected to become very strong. A black hole with the mass of a car would have a diameter of about 10{{sup|−24}}&nbsp;m and take a nanosecond to evaporate, during which time it would briefly have a luminosity of more than 200 times that of the Sun. Lower-mass black holes are expected to evaporate even faster; for example, a black hole of mass 1&nbsp;TeV/''c''{{sup|2}} would take less than 10{{sup|−88}} seconds to evaporate completely. For such a small black hole, [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] effects are expected to play an important role and could hypothetically make such a small black hole stable, although current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate this is the case.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Giddings |first1=S.

The Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak and would thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from Earth. A possible exception, however, is the burst of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of the evaporation of primordial black holes.

By nature, black holes do not themselves emit any electromagnetic radiation other than the hypothetical [[Hawking radiation]], so astrophysicists searching for black holes must generally rely on indirect observations. For example, a black hole's existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational influence upon its surroundings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Black Holes {{!}} Science Mission Directorate|url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>

On 10 April 2019 an image was released of a black hole, which is seen in magnified fashion because the light paths near the event horizon are highly bent. The dark shadow in the middle results from light paths absorbed by the black hole. The image is in false color, as the detected light halo in this image is not in the visible spectrum, but radio waves.
[[File:20190410l.tif|thumb|This artist's impression depicts the paths of photons in the vicinity of a black hole. The gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon is the cause of the shadow captured by the Event Horizon Telescope.]]

The [[Event Horizon Telescope]] (EHT), run by MIT's [[Haystack Observatory]], is an active program that directly observes the immediate environment of the event horizon of black holes, such as the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. In April 2017, EHT began observation of the black hole in the center of Messier 87.<ref name="eht">{{cite web |url=https://eventhorizontelescope.org/galleries/2017-observations |title=April 2017 Observations |work=Event Horizon Telescope |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref> "In all, eight radio observatories on six mountains and four continents observed the galaxy in Virgo on and off for 10 days in April 2017" to provide the data yielding the image two years later in April 2019.<ref name=OverbyeApril2019>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/science/black-hole-picture.html |title=Darkness Visible, Finally: Astronomers Capture First Ever Image of a Black Hole |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |date=10 April 2019 |accessdate=11 April 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> After two years of data processing, EHT released the first direct image of a black hole, specifically the supermassive black hole that lies in the center of the aforementioned galaxy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/space/100000006453594/first-image-black-hole.html |type=video |date=10 April 2019 |author=AP |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Astronomers Reveal the First Picture of a Black Hole |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Doeleman |first=Shep |title=The Event Horizon Telescope: Imaging and Time-Resolving a Black Hole |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yGSgUUYDQ8&t=46m50s |website=Physics @ Berkeley |date=4 April 2016 |time=46:50 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201115303/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yGSgUUYDQ8&t=46m50s |archivedate=1 December 2016}}</ref> What is visible is not the black hole, which shows as black because of the loss of all light within this dark region, rather it is the gases at the edge of the event horizon, which are displayed as orange or red, that define the black hole.<ref name=GrossmanApril2019>{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope |title=The first picture of a black hole opens a new era of astrophysics |date=10 April 2019 |last1=Grossman |first1=Lisa |last2=Conover |first2=Emily |newspaper=Science News |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>

The brightening of this material in the 'bottom' half of the processed EHT image is thought to be caused by [[Relativistic beaming|Doppler beaming]], whereby material approaching the viewer at relativistic speeds is perceived as brighter than material moving away. In the case of a black hole this phenomenon implies that the visible material is rotating at relativistic speeds (>1,000&nbsp;km/s), the only speeds at which it is possible to centrifugally balance the immense gravitational attraction of the singularity, and thereby remain in orbit above the event horizon. This configuration of bright material implies that the EHT observed [[M87*]] from a perspective catching the black hole's accretion disc nearly edge-on, as the whole system rotated clockwise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope|title=The first picture of a black hole opens a new era of astrophysics|date=2019-04-10|website=Science News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> However, the extreme [[gravitational lens]]ing associated with black holes produces the illusion of a perspective that sees the accretion disc from above. In reality, most of the ring in the EHT image was created when the light emitted by the far side of the accretion disc bent around the black hole's gravity well and escaped such that most of the possible perspectives on M87* can see the entire disc, even that directly behind the "shadow".

Prior to this, in 2015, the EHT detected magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of Sagittarius A*, and even discerned some of their properties. The field lines that pass through the accretion disc were found to be a complex mixture of ordered and tangled. The existence of magnetic fields had been predicted by theoretical studies of black holes.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Resolved magnetic-field structure and variability near the event horizon of Sagittarius A* |journal=Science |date=4 December 2015 |pages=1242–1245 |volume=350 |issue=6265 |doi=10.1126/science.aac7087 |first=M.

When the accreting object is a [[neutron star]] or a black hole, the gas in the inner accretion disk orbits at very high speeds because of its proximity to the [[compact object]]. The resulting friction is so significant that it heats the inner disk to temperatures at which it emits vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation (mainly X-rays). These bright X-ray sources may be detected by telescopes. This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy-producing processes known; up to 40% of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted as radiation.<ref name=McClintockRemillard2006 /> (In nuclear fusion only about 0.7% of the rest mass will be emitted as energy.) In many cases, accretion disks are accompanied by [[relativistic jets]] that are emitted along the poles, which carry away much of the energy. The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood, in part due to insufficient data.<ref>{{cite news |title=What powers a black hole's mighty jets? |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/11/what-powers-black-holes-mighty-jets |accessdate=19 March 2018 |work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=19 November 2014}}</ref>

As such, many of the universe's more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes. In particular, [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] and [[quasar]]s are believed to be the accretion disks of supermassive black holes.<ref name="CMS1999" /> Similarly, X-ray binaries are generally accepted to be [[binary star]] systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object accreting matter from its companion.<ref name="CMS1999" /> It has also been suggested that some [[ultraluminous X-ray source]]s may be the accretion disks of [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Winter |first=L.

[[X-ray binaries]] are [[binary star]] systems that emit a majority of their radiation in the [[X-ray]] part of the spectrum. These X-ray emissions are generally thought to result when one of the stars (compact object) accretes matter from another (regular) star. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides an opportunity for studying the central object and to determine if it might be a black hole.<ref name="CMS1999" />

If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole. The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star. By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and to obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object. If this is much larger than the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]] (the maximum mass a star can have without collapsing) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.<ref name="CMS1999">{{Cite journal |last1=Celotti |first1=A. |last2=Miller |first2=J.

Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients. In this class of system, the companion star is of relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates of the black hole mass. Moreover, these systems actively emit X-rays for only several months once every 10–50 years. During the period of low X-ray emission (called quiescence), the accretion disk is extremely faint allowing detailed observation of the companion star during this period. One of the best such candidates is [[V404 Cygni]].<ref name="CMS1999" />

===== Quiescence and advection-dominated accretion flow =====
The faintness of the accretion disk of an X-ray binary during quiescence is suspected to be caused by the flow of mass entering a mode called an [[advection-dominated accretion flow]] (ADAF). In this mode, almost all the energy generated by friction in the disk is swept along with the flow instead of radiated away. If this model is correct, then it forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence of an event horizon,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narayan |first1=R. |last2=McClintock |first2=J. |title=Advection-dominated accretion and the black hole event horizon |journal=New Astronomy Reviews |volume=51 |issue=10–12 |pages=733–751 |date=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.newar.2008.03.002 |bibcode=2008NewAR..51..733N |arxiv=0803.0322 |ref=harv}}</ref> since if the object at the center of the disk had a solid surface, it would emit large amounts of radiation as the highly energetic gas hits the surface,{{clarify|date=February 2016}} an effect that is observed for neutron stars in a similar state.<ref name=McClintockRemillard2006 />

===== Quasi-periodic oscillations =====
{{Main|Quasi-periodic oscillations}}

The X-ray emissions from accretion disks sometimes flicker at certain frequencies. These signals are called [[quasi-periodic oscillations]] and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk (the innermost stable circular orbit). As such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object. They can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of candidate black holes.<ref>{{cite press release |title=NASA scientists identify smallest known black hole |publisher=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]] |date=1 April 2008 |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-04/nsfc-nsi040108.php |accessdate=14 March 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227195554/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-04/nsfc-nsi040108.php |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}</ref>

Astronomers use the term "[[Active galactic nucleus|active galaxy]]" to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics, such as unusual [[spectral line]] emission and very strong radio emission. Theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be explained by the presence of [[supermassive black hole]]s, which can be millions of times more massive than stellar ones. The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the [[Sun]]; a disk of [[interstellar gas|gas]] and [[interstellar dust|dust]] called an accretion disk; and two [[relativistic jet|jets]] perpendicular to the accretion disk.<ref name="krolik1999">{{Cite book |first=J.

=== Microlensing (proposed) ===
Another way the black hole nature of an object may be tested in the future is through observation of effects caused by a strong gravitational field in their vicinity. One such effect is [[gravitational lensing]]: The deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected much as light passing through an optic [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. Observations have been made of weak gravitational lensing, in which light rays are deflected by only a few [[arcseconds]]. However, it has never been directly observed for a black hole.<ref name="Bozza" /> One possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would be to observe stars in orbit around the black hole. There are several candidates for such an observation in orbit around [[Sagittarius A*]].<ref name="Bozza">{{cite journal |arxiv=0911.2187 |last1=Bozza |first1=V. |title=Gravitational Lensing by Black Holes |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |issue=9 |date=2010 |pages=2269–2300 |doi=10.1007/s10714-010-0988-2 |bibcode=2010GReGr..42.2269B |volume=42 |ref=harv}}</ref>

The evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies on the existence of an upper limit for the mass of a neutron star.

However, it can be shown from arguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum mass.<ref name="CMS1999" />

Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass, supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes (the average density of a {{Solar mass|10{{sup|8}}}} black hole is comparable to that of water).<ref name="CMS1999" /> Consequently, the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane. For example, a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects. However, such alternatives are typically not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates.<ref name="CMS1999" />

The evidence for the existence of stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes to not form, general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] corrections. A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons and thus black holes would not be real artifacts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kiefer |first1=C. |title=Quantum gravity: general introduction and recent developments |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=15 |issue=1–2 |pages=129–148 |date=2006 |doi=10.1002/andp.200510175 |arxiv=gr-qc/0508120 |bibcode=2006AnP...518..129K |ref=harv}}</ref> For example, in the [[Fuzzball (string theory)|fuzzball]] model based on [[string theory]], the individual states of a black hole solution do not generally have an event horizon or singularity, but for a classical/semi-classical observer the statistical average of such states appears just as an ordinary black hole as deduced from general relativity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Skenderis |first1=K. |last2=Taylor |first2=M. |title=The fuzzball proposal for black holes |journal=Physics Reports |volume=467 |issue=4–5 |page=117 |date=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2008.08.001 |arxiv=0804.0552 |bibcode=2008PhR...467..117S |ref=harv}}</ref>

A few theoretical objects have been conjectured to match observations of astronomical black hole candidates identically or near-identically, but which function via a different mechanism.

=== Entropy and thermodynamics ===
{{further|Black hole thermodynamics}}
{{Image frame|content={{bigmath|1=''S'' = {{sfrac|1|4}} {{sfrac|''c''{{sup|3}}''k'' |''Għ''}} ''A''}}|caption=The formula for the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy ({{mvar|S}}) of a black hole, which depends on the area of the black hole ({{mvar|A}}). The constants are the [[speed of light]] ({{mvar|c}}), the [[Boltzmann constant]] ({{mvar|k}}), [[Newton's constant]] ({{mvar|G}}), and the [[reduced Planck constant]] ({{mvar|ħ}}). In [[Planck units]], this reduces to {{math|1=''S'' = {{sfrac|''A''|4}}}}.|width=220}}

In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions<ref group=Note>In particular, he assumed that all matter satisfies the [[weak energy condition]].</ref> that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hawking |first=S. W. |title=Gravitational Radiation from Colliding Black Holes |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=26 |issue=21 |pages=1344–1346 |date=1971 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.26.1344 |bibcode=1971PhRvL..26.1344H |ref=harv}}</ref> This result, now known as the [[second law of black hole mechanics]], is remarkably similar to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that the total [[entropy]] of an isolated system can never decrease. As with classical objects at [[absolute zero]] temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.<ref name="wald99">{{cite journal |last=Wald |first=R. M. |title=The Thermodynamics of Black Holes |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=6 |date=2001 |arxiv=gr-qc/9912119 |bibcode=2001LRR.....4....6W |doi=10.12942/lrr-2001-6 |pmid=28163633 |pmc=5253844 |ref=harv}}</ref>

The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that [[quantum field theory]] predicts that a black hole radiates [[blackbody radiation]] at a constant temperature. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in [[Planck units]] is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the [[first law of black hole mechanics]] as an analogue of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.<ref name="wald99" />

One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an [[extensive quantity]] that scales linearly with the volume of the system. This odd property led [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] to propose the [[holographic principle]], which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume.<ref>{{cite book |first=G. |last='t Hooft |chapter=The Holographic Principle |journal=Basics and Highlights in Fundamental Physics |series=Subnuclear series |volume=37 |pages=72–100 |editor-last=Zichichi |editor-first=A. |date=2001 |isbn=978-981-02-4536-8 |arxiv=hep-th/0003004 |bibcode=2001bhfp.conf...72T |doi=10.1142/9789812811585_0005|title=Basics and Highlights in Fundamental Physics }}</ref>

Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In [[statistical mechanics]], entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as [[mass]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]], [[pressure]], etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of [[quantum gravity]], one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] showed that counting the microstates of a specific [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] black hole in [[string theory]] reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Strominger |first1=A. |last2=Vafa |first2=C. |title=Microscopic origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=379 |issue=1–4 |pages=99–104 |date=1996 |doi=10.1016/0370-2693(96)00345-0 |arxiv=hep-th/9601029 |bibcode=1996PhLB..379...99S |ref=harv}}</ref> Since then, similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like [[loop quantum gravity]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Carlip |first1=S. |title=Physics of Black Holes |journal=Physics of Black Holes |volume=769 |pages=89–123 |date=2009 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88460-6_3 |arxiv=0807.4520 |series=Lecture Notes in Physics |isbn=978-3-540-88459-0 |ref=harv |bibcode=2009LNP...769...89C |chapter=Black Hole Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics}}</ref>

=== Information loss paradox ===
{{Main|Black hole information paradox}}
{{unsolved|physics|Is [[physical information]] lost in black holes?}}

Because a black hole has only a few internal parameters, most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved. As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside, but represented on the event horizon in accordance with the holographic principle. However, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole, meaning that this information appears to be gone forever.<ref name="PlayDice000">{{cite web |title=Does God Play Dice? |first=S. W. |last=Hawking |url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html |website=www.hawking.org.uk |accessdate=14 March 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111012413/http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}</ref>

The question whether information is truly lost in black holes (the [[black hole information paradox]]) has divided the theoretical physics community (see [[Thorne–Hawking–Preskill bet]]). In quantum mechanics, loss of information corresponds to the violation of vital property called [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], which has to do with the conservation of probability. It has been argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of conservation of energy.<ref name="giddings1995">{{cite conference |first=S.

=== Firewall paradox ===
{{Main|Firewall (physics)}}

According to [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]], a [[Black-body radiation|single emission]] of [[Hawking radiation]] involves two mutually [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. The outgoing particle escapes and is emitted as a quantum of Hawking radiation; the infalling particle is swallowed by the black hole. Assume a black hole formed a finite time in the past and will fully evaporate away in some finite time in the future. Then, it will emit only a finite amount of information encoded within its Hawking radiation. Assume that at time <math>t</math>, more than half of the information had already been emitted. According to widely accepted research by physicists like [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Don N. |title=Information in black hole radiation |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |date=1993 |volume=71 |issue=23 |pages=3743–3746 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.3743 |pmid=10055062 |bibcode=1993PhRvL..71.3743P |arxiv=hep-th/9306083 |citeseerx=10.1.1.267.174}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Don N. |title=Average entropy of a subsystem |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |date=1993 |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=1291–1294 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1291 |pmid=10055503 |bibcode=1993PhRvL..71.1291P |arxiv=gr-qc/9305007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.339.7694}}</ref> and [[Leonard Susskind]], an outgoing particle emitted at time <math>t</math> must be entangled with all the Hawking radiation the black hole has previously emitted. This creates a paradox: a principle called "monogamy of entanglement" requires that, like any quantum system, the outgoing particle cannot be fully entangled with two independent systems at the same time; yet here the outgoing particle appears to be entangled both with the infalling particle and, independently, with past Hawking radiation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Astrophysics: Fire in the hole! |url=http://www.nature.com/news/astrophysics-fire-in-the-hole-1.12726 |accessdate=20 December 2016 |work=Nature |date=4 April 2013 |pages=20–23 |doi=10.1038/496020a |bibcode=2013Natur.496...20M |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208112717/http://www.nature.com/news/astrophysics-fire-in-the-hole-1.12726 |archivedate=8 December 2016}}</ref>

In order to resolve the paradox, physicists may eventually be forced to give up one of three time-tested theories: Einstein's [[equivalence principle]], [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], or existing [[quantum field theory]]. One possible solution, which violates the equivalence principle, is that a "firewall" destroys incoming particles at the event horizon.<ref name="sciam/Confound">{{cite news |last=Ouellette |first=Jennifer |title=Black Hole Firewalls Confound Theoretical Physicists |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=black-hole-firewalls-confound-theoretical-physicists |accessdate=29 October 2013 |newspaper=Scientific American |date=21 December 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109142243/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=black-hole-firewalls-confound-theoretical-physicists |archivedate=9 November 2013}} [http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20121221-alice-and-bob-meet-the-wall-of-fire/ Originally published] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603204112/http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20121221-alice-and-bob-meet-the-wall-of-fire/ |date=3 June 2014 }} in Quanta, 21 December 2012.</ref> A 2016 analysis of LIGO data shows tentative signs of echoes caused by a fuzzy event horizon; such echoes may be possible in firewall or [[fuzzball (string theory)|fuzzball]] theories but should not occur in classical general relativity.
