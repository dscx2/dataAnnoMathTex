{{sustainable energy}}

'''Sustainable energy''' is the practice of using [[energy]] in a way that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."{{sfn | Kutscher | Milford | Kreith | 2018 | Chapter=1.1.2}}<ref name=REEEP>{{cite web |url=https://www.reeep.org/sites/default/files/Glossary%20of%20Terms%20in%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Regulation.pdf |title=Glossary of terms in sustainable energy regulation |author1=Renewable Energy |author2=Efficiency Partnership |lastauthoramp=yes |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2008-12-19 }}</ref>

When referring to methods of producing energy, the term "sustainable energy" is often used interchangeably with the term "[[renewable energy]]". In general, renewable energy sources such as [[solar energy]], [[wind energy]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[tidal energy]], are widely considered to be sustainable. However, particular renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests for production of [[biofuel]]s, can lead to similar or even worse environmental damage when compared with using [[fossil fuel]] energy. There is considerable controversy over whether [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] can be considered sustainable.

Sustainable energy sources can be used to generate electricity, to heat and cool buildings, and to power transportation systems and machines. Costs of sustainable energy sources have decreased immensely throughout the years, and continue to fall. Increasingly, effective government policies support investor confidence and these markets are expanding.

Sustainable energy strategies generally involve both the use of sustainable energy sources, and improvements in [[energy conservation]]. The [[organizing principle]] for sustainability is [[sustainable development]], which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.<ref>{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice| url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719

==Definitions==
The concept of [[sustainable development]] was described by the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] in its 1987 book ''[[Our Common Future]]''.{{sfn | Kutscher | Milford | Kreith | 2018 | Chapter=1.1.2}} Its definition of "sustainability", now used widely, was, "Sustainable development should meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."{{sfn | Kutscher | Milford | Kreith | 2018 | Chapter=1.1.2}}

In its book, the Commission described four key elements of sustainability with respect to energy: the ability to increase the supply of energy to meet growing human needs, energy efficiency and conservation, public health and safety, and "protection of the biosphere and prevention of more localized forms of pollution."<ref name="Our Common Future">{{cite book | title=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|last= [[World Commission on Environment and Development]]| publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford New York | year=1987 | isbn=978-0-19-282080-8 | oclc=15489268 |chapter-url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|chapter=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development }}</ref> Various definitions of sustainable energy have been offered since then which are also based on the three pillars of sustainable development, namely environment, economy, and society.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

*'''Environmental''' criteria include [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], impact on [[biodiversity]], and the production of hazardous waste and toxic emissions.
*'''Economic''' criteria include the cost of energy, whether energy is delivered to users with high reliability, and effects on jobs associated with energy production.
*'''Socio-cultural''' criteria include the prevention of wars over the energy supply ([[energy security]]) and long-term availability of energy.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

'''Green energy''' is energy that can be extracted, generated, and/or consumed without any significant negative impact to the environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The planet has a natural capability to recover which means pollution that does not go beyond that capability can still be termed green. It represents those renewable energy resources and technologies that provide the highest environmental benefit. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] defines green power as electricity produced from [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], [[geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[biogas]], [[biomass]] and low-impact small [[hydroelectric]] sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/index.htm |title=Green Power Defined &#124; Green Power Partnership &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref>

===Hydropower===
{{Main|Hydropower}}

Among sources of renewable energy, hydroelectric plants have the advantages of being long-lived—many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Also, hydroelectric plants are clean and have few emissions. Criticisms directed at large-scale hydroelectric plants include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, and release of [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|significant amounts of carbon dioxide]] during construction and flooding of the reservoir.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed] ''New Scientist'', 24 February 2005.</ref>

[[File:Nishidaira Dam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric dams]] are one of the most widely deployed sources of sustainable energy.]]

However, it has been found that high emissions are associated only with shallow reservoirs in warm (tropical) locales, and recent innovations in hydropower turbine technology are enabling efficient development of low-impact [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] projects.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferris|first=David|title=The Power of the Dammed: How Small Hydro Could Rescue America's Dumb Dams|url=http://www.ecomagination.com/the-power-of-the-dammed-how-small-hydro-could-rescue-america-dumb-dams|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=3 November 2011}}</ref> Generally speaking, hydroelectric plants produce much lower life-cycle emissions than other types of generation. Hydroelectric power, which underwent extensive development during growth of electrification in the 19th and 20th centuries, is experiencing resurgence of development in the 21st century. The areas of greatest hydroelectric growth are the booming economies of Asia. China is the development leader; however, other Asian nations are installing hydropower at a rapid pace. This growth is driven by much increased energy costs—especially for imported energy—and widespread desires for more domestically produced, clean, renewable, and economical generation.

[[Biomass]] is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. As an energy source, biomass can either be burned to produce heat and to generate electricity, or converted to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Liquid biofuels such as [[biodiesel]] and [[ethanol]] are especially valued as energy sources for motor vehicles.

Biomass is extremely versatile and one of the most-used sources of renewable energy. It is available in many countries, which makes it attractive for reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. If the production of biomass is well-managed, [[carbon emissions]] can be significantly offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the plants during their lifespans. If the biomass source is agricultural or municipal waste, burning it or converting it into [[biogas]] also provides a way to dispose of this waste.{{sfn|Tester|2012|p=512}}

As of 2012, wood remains the largest biomass energy source today.<ref name="online.wsj.com">[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842] Retrieved on 12 April 2012.</ref>  If biomass is harvested from crops, such as tree plantations, the cultivation of these crops can [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|displace natural ecosystems]], [[soil degradation|degrade soils]], and consume water resources and synthetic fertilizers.{{sfn|Tester|2012|p=512}}{{sfn|Smil|2017|p=162}} In some cases, these impacts can actually result in higher overall carbon emissions compared to using petroleum-based fuels.{{sfn|Smil|2017|p=162}}{{sfn|Edenhofer|2014|p=616}}

Use of farmland for growing fuel can result in [[food vs. fuel|less land being available for growing food]]. Since [[photosynthesis]] is inherently inefficient, and crops also require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport, the amount of energy produced per unit of land area is very small, in the range of 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 1.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>.{{sfn | Smil | 2017 | p=161}} In the United States, [[Corn ethanol|corn-based ethanol]] has replaced less than 10% of motor gasoline use since 2011, but has consumed around 40% of the annual corn harvest in the country.{{sfn|Smil|2017|p=162}} In Malaysia and Indonesia, the clearing of forests to produce [[palm oil]] for biodiesel has led to [[Social and environmental impact of palm oil|serious social and environmental effects]], as these forests are critical [[carbon sink]]s and habitats for endangered species.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/magazine/palm-oil-borneo-climate-catastrophe.html|title=Palm Oil Was Supposed to Help Save the Planet.

===Wind===
In Europe in the 19th century, there were about 200,000 windmills, slightly more than the modern wind turbines of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/10/history-of-industrial-windmills.html|title=Wind powered factories: history (and future) of industrial windmills|website=LOW-TECH MAGAZINE}}</ref> They were mainly used to grind grain and to pump water. The age of coal powered steam engines replaced this early use of wind power.

Wind power has high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs. At the end of 2008, worldwide [[wind farm]] capacity was 120,791 [[megawatts]] (MW), representing an increase of 28.8 percent during the year,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gko0QmIaJ8jg0oNeiaU3ql5VRwPw |title=Wind energy gathers steam, US biggest market: survey |date=2009-02-02 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref> and [[wind power]] produced some 1.3% of global electricity consumption.<ref>World Wind Energy Association (2008).

===Solar heating===
[[Solar heating]] systems generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pool water, or for space heating.<ref>
[http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/solar-water-heaters Solar water heating] energy.gov</ref> The heat can also be used for industrial applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |title=Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |archivedate=5 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In many climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (20 to 80%) of domestic hot water energy.
Energy received from the sun by the earth is that of electromagnetic radiation. Light ranges of visible, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and radio waves received by the earth through solar energy. The highest power of radiation comes from visible light. Solar power is complicated due to changes in seasons and from day to night. Cloud cover can also add to complications of solar energy, and not all radiation from the sun reaches earth because it is absorbed and dispersed due to clouds and gases within the earth's atmospheres.<ref>''Energy and the Environment'', Jack J Kraushaar and Robert A Ristinen, section 4.2 ''Energy from the Sun'' pg.92</ref>

Solar electricity production uses [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells to convert light into electrical current. Photovoltaic modules can be integrated into buildings or used in [[photovoltaic power stations]] connected to the electrical grid. They are especially useful for providing [[remote-area power supply|electricity to remote areas]].

Large national and regional research projects on [[artificial photosynthesis]] are designing [[nanotechnology]]-based systems that use solar energy to split water into hydrogen fuel.<ref>Collings AF and Critchley C.

Most current solar power plants are made from an array of similar units where each unit is continuously adjusted, e.g., with some step motors, so that the light converter stays in focus of the sun light. The cost of focusing light on converters such as high-power solar panels, [[Stirling engine]], etc. can be dramatically decreased with a simple and efficient rope mechanics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitb.de/nolting/energytech/energytechnol.html |title=Concepts for new sustainable energy technologies |publisher=Pitb.de |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> In this technique many units are connected with a network of ropes so that pulling two or three ropes is sufficient to keep all light converters simultaneously in focus as the direction of the sun changes.

Research is ongoing in [[space-based solar power]], a concept in which solar panels are launched into outer space and the energy they capture is transmitted back to Earth as microwaves. A test facility for the technology is being built in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/solar-farms-space-could-be-renewable-energy-s-next-frontier-ncna967451|title=Solar farms in space could be renewable energy's next frontier|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>

Most [[electric grid]]s were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as hydroelectricity or coal-fired power plants. In general, up to around 30% of the energy supplied to an electric grid can be easily converted to intermittent sources.<ref name="APS">{{cite web |last1=American Physical Society Panel on Public Affairs |title=Integrating Renewable Electricity on the Grid |url=https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/upload/integratingelec-exsum.pdf |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref>

If intermittent sources make up a larger percentage of the energy supply for a given electric grid,  there are several possible approaches to ensuring that electricity generation can meet ongoing demand:
* Reducing demand for electricity at certain times through [[energy demand management]] and use of [[smart grid]]s.
* Using hydroelectricity or [[Natural gas#Power generation|natural gas generation]] to produce backup power 
* Importing electricity from other locations through long-distance [[Electric power transmission|transmission lines]]. For example, [[Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation|TREC]] has proposed to distribute solar power from the Sahara to Europe. Europe can distribute wind and ocean power to the Sahara and other countries. In this way, power is produced at any given time as at any point of the planet as the sun or the wind is up or ocean waves and currents are stirring.
* Using [[grid energy storage]] to store excess solar and wind energy and release it as needed. The most commonly-used storage method is [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], which is feasible only at locations that are next to a large hill or a deep underground mine. Other storage technologies are [[flywheel energy storage]], [[compressed air]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and [[hydrogen fuel]].

As of 2019, the cost and logistics of energy storage for large population centres is a significant challenge, although the cost of battery systems has plunged dramatically.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20022019/100-percent-renewable-energy-battery-storage-need-worst-case-polar-vortex-wind-solar|title=100% Renewable Energy Needs Lots of Storage. This Polar Vortex Test Showed How Much.|date=2019-02-20|website=InsideClimate News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>  For instance, a 2019 study found that for solar and wind energy to meet energy demand for a week of extreme cold in the eastern and midwest United States, energy storage capacity would have to increase from the 11 GW currently in place to 277.9 GW.<ref name=":1" />

Some costs could potentially be reduced by making use of energy storage equipment the consumer buys and not the state. An example is [[Grid energy storage|batteries]] in electric cars that would double as an energy buffer for the electricity grid. Energy storage apparatus' as car batteries are also built with materials that pose a threat to the environment (e.g. Lithium). The combined production of batteries for such a large part of the population would still have environmental concerns.

To provide household electricity in remote areas (that is areas which are not connected to the [[Mains electricity|mains electricity grid]]), energy storage is required for use with renewable energy. Energy generation and consumption systems used in the latter case are usually [[stand-alone power system]]s.

Energy from renewable sources can also be stored as heat or cold, through [[thermal energy storage]] technologies. For instance, summer heat can be stored for winter heating, or winter cold can be stored for summer air conditioning.

==Non-renewable energy sources==
===Nuclear power===
{{Main|Nuclear power debate}}

[[Nuclear power]] plants have been used since the 1950s to produce a steady supply of electricity, without creating local air pollution. In 2012, nuclear power plants in 30 countries generated 11% of global electricity.{{sfn|Bruckner|2014|p=530}} The [[IPCC]] considers nuclear power to be a low-carbon energy source, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (including the mining and processing of [[uranium]]), similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources.<ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III">{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex III: Technology - specific cost and performance parameters

 |publisher=IPCC|accessdate=2018-12-14|page=7|year=2014}}</ref>

There is considerable controversy over whether nuclear power can be considered sustainable, with debates revolving around the risk of nuclear accidents (such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]]), the cost and construction time needed to build new plants, the generation of radioactive [[nuclear waste]], and the potential for nuclear energy to contribute to [[nuclear proliferation]]. These concerns have led to a decrease in the contribution of nuclear energy to the global electricity supply since 1993.{{sfn|Bruckner|2014|p=517}} At a global level, opposition to nuclear energy stood at 62 percent in 2011.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy|title=It goes completely against what most believe, but out of all major energy sources, nuclear is the safest|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> Public support for nuclear energy is often low as a result of safety concerns, however for each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy is far safer than fossil fuel energy.<ref name=":2" />

Others, including [[Greenpeace]]'s [[Phil Radford]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/nuclear |title=End the nuclear age &#124; Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace.org |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/nuclear/nuclear-power-briefing.pdf|title=The Case Against Nuclear Power - Greenpeace International|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024422/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/nuclear/nuclear-power-briefing.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> disagree. Newer nuclear reactor designs are capable of burning [[nuclear waste]] until it is no longer (or dramatically less) dangerous, and have design features that greatly minimize the possibility of a nuclear accident. These designs have yet to be commercialized. (See: [[Molten salt reactor]]) Some forms of nuclear power can "burn" nuclear waste through a process known as [[nuclear transmutation]], such as an [[Integral Fast Reactor]]. Nuclear power plants can be more or less eliminated from their problem of nuclear waste through the use of [[nuclear reprocessing]] and newer plants such as [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeder]] plants.

===Carbon capture and storage===
In theory, the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of fossil fuel power plants can be significantly reduced through [[carbon capture and storage]], although this process is expensive. Some believe that fossil fuel burning, with carbon capture and storage, may have a role in a sustainable energy system.

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main|Efficient use of energy}}
Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.<ref>InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/File.aspx?id=24548 ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future'' p. xvii.]</ref>

Efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. A recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand, which is due to continuing economic and [[population growth]]. As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase. Thus, given the thermodynamic and practical limits of energy efficiency improvements, slowing the growth in energy demand is essential.<ref>Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, {{ISBN|978-0-86571-704-6}}.</ref> However, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.<ref>American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).

==Clean cookstoves==
{{Main|Cook stove}}
In [[developing countries]], an estimated 3 billion people rely on traditional cookstoves and open fires to burn biomass or coal for heating and cooking. This practice causes harmful local air pollution and increases danger from fires, resulting in an estimated 4.3 million deaths annually.<ref name="Washington Post 2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/these-cheap-clean-stoves-were-supposed-to-save-millions-of-lives-what-happened/2015/10/29/c0b98f38-77fa-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html|title=These cheap, clean stoves were supposed to save millions of lives. What happened?|date=29 October 2015|website=Washington Post|access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref> Additionally, serious local environmental damage, including [[desertification]], can be caused by excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material.{{sfn|Tester|2012|p=504}} Promoting usage of cleaner fuels and more efficient technologies for cooking is therefore one of the top priorities of the United Nations [[Sustainable Energy for All]] initiative. Thus far, efforts to design cookstoves that are inexpensive, powered by sustainable energy sources, and  acceptable to users have been mostly disappointing.<ref name="Washington Post 2015"/>

==Trends==
[[Climate change]] concerns coupled with [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the sustainable energy industries, according to a trend analysis from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. According to [[UNEP]], global investment in sustainable energy in 2007 was higher than previous levels, with $148 billion of new money raised in 2007, an increase of 60% over 2006. Total financial transactions in sustainable energy, including acquisition activity, was $204 billion.<ref name=invest>[http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Global_Trends_2008.pdf Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908124238/http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Global_Trends_2008.pdf |date=8 September 2008 }} p. 8.</ref>

Investment flows in 2007 broadened and diversified, making the overall picture one of greater breadth and depth of sustainable energy use. The mainstream capital markets are "now fully receptive to sustainable energy companies, supported by a surge in funds destined for clean energy investment".<ref name=invest/>
The increased levels of investment and the fact that much of the capital is coming from more conventional financial actors suggest that sustainable energy options are now becoming mainstream.<ref>United Nations Environment Programme and New Energy Finance Ltd. (2007), p. 17.</ref>

==Purchasing green electricity==
[[File:Solar Array.jpg|thumb|A [[solar trough]] array is an example of green energy.]]
[[File:Solar panel for charging phone.jpg|thumb|Public seat with integrated solar panel in [[Singapore]]-anyone can sit and plug in their mobile phone for free charging]]

In several [[nation|countries]] with [[common carrier]] arrangements, [[electricity retailing]] arrangements make it possible for consumers to purchase "green" electricity from either their utility or a green power provider. Electricity is considered to be green if it is produced from a source that produces relatively little pollution, and the concept is often considered equivalent to [[renewable energy]].<ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/greenpower.shtml Green power], fueleconomy.gov</ref>

In many countries, green energy currently provides a very small amount of electricity, generally contributing less than 2 to 5% to the overall pool of electricity offered by most [[public utility|utility companies]], [[electrical power industry|electric companies]], or state power pools. In some U.S. states, local governments have formed regional power purchasing pools using [[Community Choice Aggregation]] and [[Solar Bonds]] to achieve a 51% renewable mix or higher, such as in the City of San Francisco.<ref>San Francisco Community Choice Program Design, Draft Implementation Plan and H Bond Action Plan, Ordinance 447-07, 2007.</ref>

By participating in a green energy program a consumer may be having an effect on the energy sources used and ultimately might be helping to promote and expand the use of green energy. They are also making a statement to policy makers that they are willing to pay a price premium to support renewable energy. Green energy consumers either obligate the utility companies to increase the amount of green energy that they purchase from the pool (so decreasing the amount of non-green energy they purchase), or directly fund the green energy through a green power provider. If insufficient green energy sources are available, the utility must develop new ones or [[contract]] with a third party energy supplier to provide green energy, causing more to be built. However, there is no way the consumer can check whether or not the electricity bought is "green" or otherwise.

In some countries such as the Netherlands, electricity companies guarantee to buy an equal amount of 'green power' as is being used by their green power customers. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government exempts green power from pollution taxes, which means green power is hardly any more expensive than other power.

The most popular way to purchase renewable energy as revealed by [[NREL]] data is through purchasing [[Renewable Energy Certificate]]s (RECs). According to a [[Natural Marketing Institute]] (NMI)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmisolutions.com |title=Health & Wellness Consumer Market Research.

DOE selected six companies for its 2007 Green Power Supplier Awards, including [[Constellation NewEnergy]]; [[3Degrees]]; [[Sterling Planet]]; [[SunEdison]]; [[PacifiCorp|Pacific Power]] and [[Rocky Mountain Power]]; and [[Silicon Valley Power]]. The combined green power provided by those six winners equals more than 5 billion [[kilowatt-hour]]s per year, which is enough to power nearly 465,000 average U.S. households. In 2014, Arcadia Power made RECS available to homes and businesses in all 50 states, allowing consumers to use "100% green power" as defined by the EPA's Green Power Partnership.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Power Partnership|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/index.htm|website=EPA.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422075645/http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/index.htm|archivedate=22 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How It Works|url=http://arcadiapower.com/how-it-works/|website=ArcadiaPower.com}}</ref>

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that supports the organizational procurement of [[renewable electricity]] by offering expert advice, technical support, tools and resources. This can help organizations lower the transaction costs of buying renewable power, reduce [[carbon footprint]], and communicate its leadership to key stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/grnpower/ |title=Green Power Partnership &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref>

Throughout the country, more than half of all U.S. electricity customers now have an option to purchase some type of green power product from a retail [[electricity market|electricity provider]]. Roughly one-quarter of the nation's utilities offer green power programs to customers, and voluntary retail sales of renewable energy in the United States totaled more than 12 billion kilowatt-hours in 2006, a 40% increase over the previous year.

In the United States, one of the main problems with purchasing green energy through the electrical grid is the current centralized infrastructure that supplies the consumer’s electricity. This infrastructure has led to increasingly frequent brown outs and black outs, high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, higher energy costs, and power quality issues.<ref>U.S. Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.[http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability]</ref> An additional $450 billion will be invested to expand this fledgling system over the next 20 years to meet increasing demand.<ref>"Energy Distribution" U.S. Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.[http://www.electricdistribution.ctc.com/pdfs/GridWise%20Fact%20Sheet%20Jan05]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In addition, this centralized system is now being further overtaxed with the incorporation of renewable energies such as wind, solar, and geothermal energies. Renewable resources, due to the amount of space they require, are often located in remote areas where there is a lower energy demand. The current infrastructure would make transporting this energy to high demand areas, such as urban centers, highly inefficient and in some cases impossible. In addition, despite the amount of renewable energy produced or the economic viability of such technologies only about 20 percent will be able to be incorporated into the grid. To have a more sustainable energy profile, the United States must move towards implementing changes to the electrical grid that will accommodate a mixed-fuel economy.<ref>[Whittington, H.W. "Electricity generation: Options for reduction in carbon emissions". Philosophical transactions in mathematics, physical, and engineering sciences. Vol. 360, No. 1797. (15 August 2002) Published by: The Royal Society]</ref>

Several initiatives are being proposed to mitigate distribution problems. First and foremost, the most effective way to reduce USA’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and slow global warming is through conservation efforts. Opponents of the current US electrical grid have also advocated for decentralizing the grid. This system would increase efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost in transmission. It would also be economically viable as it would reduce the amount of power lines that will need to be constructed in the future to keep up with demand. Merging heat and power in this system would create added benefits and help to increase its efficiency by up to 80-90%. This is a significant increase from the current fossil fuel plants which only have an efficiency of 34%.<ref>[[Joseph Romm|Romm, Joseph]]; Levine, Mark; Brown, Marilyn; Peterson, Eric.

{{Main|Microgeneration}}
Those not satisfied with the third-party grid approach to green energy via the power grid can install their own locally based renewable energy system. Renewable energy electrical systems from solar to wind to even local hydro-power in some cases, are some of the many types of renewable energy systems available locally. Additionally, for those interested in heating and cooling their dwelling via renewable energy, [[geothermal exchange heat pump|geothermal heat pump]] systems that tap the constant [[temperature]] of the earth, which is around 7 to 15 degrees [[Celsius]] a few feet underground and increases dramatically at greater depths, are an option over conventional [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]]-fueled heat approaches. Also, in geographic locations where the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's Crust]] is especially thin, or near [[volcanoes]] (as is the case in [[Iceland]]) there exists the potential to generate even more electricity than would be possible at other sites, thanks to a more significant [[temperature gradient]] at these locales.

The advantage of this approach in the United States is that many states offer incentives to offset the cost of installation of a renewable energy system. In California, Massachusetts and several other U.S. states, a new approach to community energy supply called [[Community Choice Aggregation]] has provided communities with the means to solicit a competitive electricity supplier and use municipal revenue bonds to finance development of local green energy resources. Individuals are usually assured that the electricity they are using is actually produced from a green energy source that they control. Once the system is paid for, the owner of a renewable energy system will be producing their own renewable electricity for essentially no cost and can sell the excess to the local utility at a profit.

===Solar===
{{Main|Solar power|Artificial photosynthesis}}
Currently, photovoltaic (PV) panels only have the ability to convert around 24% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png|title=NREL Photovoltaic Efficiency Chart|accessdate=2017-04-19|publisher=NREL}}</ref> At this rate, solar energy still holds many challenges for widespread implementation, but steady progress has been made in reducing manufacturing cost and increasing photovoltaic efficiency. In 2008, researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.html |title='Major discovery' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=MIT News}}</ref> Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining.
In February 2012, North Carolina-based Semprius Inc., announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel. The company claims that the prototype converts 33.9% of the sunlight that hits it to electricity, more than double the previous high-end conversion rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/breakthrough-worlds-most-efficient-solar-panel/12800 |title=Breakthrough: World's most efficient solar panel|accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=SmartPlanet}}</ref> Major projects on [[artificial photosynthesis]] or solar fuels are also under way in many developed nations.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C3EE40534F|title=Artificial photosynthesis as a frontier technology for energy sustainability|journal=Energy & Environmental Science|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1074|year=2013|last1=Faunce|first1=Thomas|last2=Styring|first2=Stenbjorn|last3=Wasielewski|first3=Michael R.|last4=Brudvig|first4=Gary W.|last5=Rutherford|first5=A.

A '''wind farm''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA and China.<ref name=terragen>{{cite web |url=http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-$650-Million-.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902091230/http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-%24650-Million-.aspx |archivedate=2 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Europe leads in the use of wind power with almost 66 GW, about 66 percent of the total globally, with Denmark in the lead according to the countries installed per-capita capacity.<ref>Smil, Vaclav.

==Government promotion of sustainable energy==
{{Main|Renewable energy commercialization}}

Around the world many sub-national governments - regions, states and provinces - have aggressively pursued sustainable energy investments. In the United States, California's leadership in renewable energy was recognised by The Climate Group when it awarded former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger its inaugural award for international climate leadership in Copenhagen in 2009.<ref name="theclimategroup.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.theclimategroup.org|title=The Climate Group|website=The Climate Group|date=18 May 2016}}</ref> In Australia, the state of South Australia - under the leadership of former Premier Mike Rann - has led the way with wind power comprising 26% of its electricity generation by the end of 2011, edging out coal fired generation for the first time.<ref name="theclimategroup.org"/> South Australia also has had the highest take-up per capita of household [[solar panel]]s in Australia following the Rann Government's introduction of solar feed-in laws and educative campaign involving the installation of solar photovoltaic installations on the roofs of prominent public buildings, including the parliament, museum, airport and Adelaide Showgrounds pavilion and schools.<ref>Centre for National Policy, Washington DC, 2 April 2012</ref> Rann, Australia's first climate change minister, passed legislation in 2006 setting targets for renewable energy and emissions cuts, the first legislation in Australia to do so.<ref>Conservation Council of SA, 2 March 2006. "Rann's climate laws a first for Australia"</ref>

Also, in the European Union there is a clear trend of promoting policies encouraging investments and financing for sustainable energy in terms of energy efficiency, innovation in energy exploitation and development of renewable resources, with increased consideration of environmental aspects and sustainability.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}</ref>

In October 2018, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released its annual "State Energy Efficiency Scorecard." The scorecard concluded that states and electric utility companies are continuing to expand energy efficiency measures in order to meet clean energy goals. In 2017, the U.S. spent $6.6 billion in electricity efficiency programs. $1.3 billion was spent on natural gas efficiency. These programs resulted in 27.3 million megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity saved.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/15292-states-utilities-see-investments-in-energy-efficiency-programs-grow/|title=States, utilities see investments in energy efficiency programs grow - Daily Energy Insider|date=2018-10-10|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref>
