In [[classical mechanics]], the '''two-body problem''' is to determine the motion of two point particles that interact only with each other. Common examples include a [[satellite]] orbiting a [[planet]], a [[planet]] orbiting a [[star]], [[2|two]] [[star]]s orbiting each other (a [[binary star]]), and a classical [[electron]] orbiting an [[atomic nucleus]] (although to solve the electron/nucleus 2-body system correctly, a quantum mechanical approach must be used).

The two-body problem can be re-formulated as two '''one-body problems''', a trivial one and one that involves solving for the motion of one particle in an external [[potential]]. Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly, the corresponding two-body problem can also be solved. By contrast, the [[three-body problem]] (and, more generally, the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]] for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3) cannot be solved in terms of first integrals, except in special cases.

Let '''x'''<sub>1</sub> and '''x'''<sub>2</sub> be the vector positions of the two bodies, and ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''m''<sub>2</sub> be their masses. The goal is to determine the trajectories '''x'''<sub>1</sub>(''t'') and '''x'''<sub>2</sub>(''t'') for all times ''t'', given the initial positions '''x'''<sub>1</sub>(''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) and '''x'''<sub>2</sub>(''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) and the initial velocities '''v'''<sub>1</sub>(''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) and '''v'''<sub>2</sub>(''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).

When applied to the two masses, [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law]] states that

:<math>
\mathbf{F}_{12}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}) = m_{1} \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1} \quad \quad \quad (\mathrm{Equation} \ 1)
</math>

:<math>
\mathbf{F}_{21}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}) = m_{2} \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{2} \quad \quad \quad (\mathrm{Equation} \  2)
</math>

where '''F'''<sub>12</sub> is the force on mass 1 due to its interactions with mass 2, and '''F'''<sub>21</sub> is the force on mass 2 due to its interactions with mass 1. The two dots on top of the '''x''' position vectors denote their second derivative with respect to time, or their acceleration vectors.

Adding and subtracting these two equations decouples them into two one-body problems, which can be solved independently. ''Adding'' equations (1) and (2) results in an equation describing the [[center of mass]] ([[barycenter]]) motion. By contrast, ''subtracting'' equation (2) from equation (1) results in an equation that describes how the vector '''r'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''x'''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;'''x'''<sub>2</sub> between the masses changes with time. The solutions of these independent one-body problems can be combined to obtain the solutions for the trajectories '''x'''<sub>1</sub>(''t'') and '''x'''<sub>2</sub>(''t'').

=== Center of mass motion (1st one-body problem) ===

Let <math>\mathbf{R} </math> be the position of the [[center of mass]] ([[barycenter]]) of the system. Addition of the force equations (1) and (2) yields

:<math>
m_{1}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_1 + m_2 \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_2 = (m_1 + m_2)\ddot{\mathbf{R}}  = \mathbf{F}_{12} + \mathbf{F}_{21} = 0
</math>

where we have used [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]] '''F'''<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;'''F'''<sub>21</sub> and where

:<math>
\ddot{\mathbf{R}}  \equiv \frac{m_{1}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + m_{2}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}}.
</math>

The resulting equation:

:<math>
\ddot{\mathbf{R}}  = 0
</math>

shows that the velocity '''V'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d'''''R'''/''dt'' of the center of mass is constant, from which follows that the total momentum ''m''<sub>1</sub> '''v'''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''m''<sub>2</sub> '''v'''<sub>2</sub> is also constant ([[conservation of momentum]]). Hence, the position '''R''' (''t'') of the center of mass can be determined at all times from the initial positions and velocities.

===Displacement vector motion (2nd one-body problem)===
Dividing both force equations by the respective masses, subtracting the second equation from the first and rearranging gives the equation

:<math>
\ddot {\mathbf{r}} = \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1} - \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{2} = 
\left( \frac{\mathbf{F}_{12}}{m_{1}} - \frac{\mathbf{F}_{21}}{m_{2}} \right) =
\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}} + \frac{1}{m_{2}} \right)\mathbf{F}_{12}
</math>

where we have again used [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]] '''F'''<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;'''F'''<sub>21</sub> and where '''r''' is the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]] from mass 2 to mass 1, as defined above.

The force between the two objects, which originates in the two objects, should only be a function of their separation '''r''' and not of their absolute positions '''x'''<sub>1</sub> and '''x'''<sub>2</sub>; otherwise, there would not be [[translational symmetry]], and the laws of physics would have to change from place to place. The subtracted equation can therefore be written:

:<math>
\mu \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{F}_{12}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}) = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})
</math>

where <math>\mu</math> is the '''[[reduced mass]]'''

:<math>
\mu = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{m_1} + \frac{1}{m_{2}}} = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}.
</math>

Solving the equation for '''r'''(''t'') is the key to the two-body problem; general solution methods are described below.  

Once '''R''' (''t'') and '''r'''(''t'') have been determined, the original trajectories may be obtained

:<math>
\mathbf{x}_1(t) = 
\mathbf{R} (t) + \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \mathbf{r}(t)
</math>

:<math>
\mathbf{x}_2(t) = 
\mathbf{R} (t) - \frac{m_{1}}{m_1 + m_2} \mathbf{r}(t)
</math>

as may be verified by substituting the definitions of '''R'''  and '''r''' into the right-hand sides of these two equations.

== Two-body motion is planar ==

The motion of two bodies with respect to each other always lies in a plane (in the [[center of mass frame]]). 

Proof: Defining the [[linear momentum]] '''p''' and the [[angular momentum]] '''L''' of the system, with respect to the center of mass, by the equations

:<math>
\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{r} \times \mu \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt},
</math>

where µ is the [[reduced mass]] and '''r''' is the relative position '''r<sub>2</sub>'''-'''r<sub>1</sub>''' (with these written taking the center of mass as the origin, and thus both parallel to '''r''') the rate of change of the angular momentum '''L''' equals the net [[torque]] '''N'''

:<math>
\mathbf{N} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \dot{\mathbf{r}} \times \mu\dot{\mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{r} \times \mu\ddot{\mathbf{r}} \ ,
</math>

and using the property of the [[vector cross product]] that '''v''' × '''w''' = '''0''' for any vectors '''''v''''' and '''''w''''' pointing in the same direction,

:<math>
 \mathbf{N} \ = \ \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} \ ,
</math>

with '''F''' = µ ''d'' <sup>2</sup>'''r''' / ''dt'' <sup>2</sup>.

Introducing the assumption (true of most physical forces, as they obey [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's strong third law of motion]]) that the force between two particles acts along the line between their positions, it follows that '''r''' × '''F'''&nbsp;= &nbsp;'''0''' and the [[conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum vector '''L''' is constant]] (conserved). Therefore, the displacement vector '''r''' and its velocity '''v''' are always in the plane [[perpendicular]] to the constant vector '''L'''.

== Energy of the two-body system ==

If the force '''F'''('''r''') is [[Conservative force|conservative]] then the system has a [[potential energy]] ''U''('''r'''), so the total [[Mechanical energy|energy]] can be written as
:<math>E_\text{tot} = {1 \over 2} m_1 \dot{\mathbf{x}}_1^2 + {1 \over 2} m_2 \dot{\mathbf{x}}_2^2 + U(\mathbf{r}) = {1 \over 2} (m_1 + m_2) \dot{\mathbf{R}}^2 + {1 \over 2} \mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 + U(\mathbf{r})</math>

In the center of mass frame the [[Kinetic energy#Frame of reference|kinetic energy]] is the lowest and the total energy becomes
:<math>E = {1 \over 2} \mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 + U(\mathbf{r})</math>
The coordinates '''x'''<sub>1</sub> and '''x'''<sub>2</sub> can be expressed as
:<math> \mathbf{x}_1 = \frac{\mu}{m_1} \mathbf{r}</math>
:<math> \mathbf{x}_2 = - \frac{\mu}{m_2} \mathbf{r}</math> 
and in a similar way the energy ''E'' is related to the energies ''E''<sub>1</sub> and ''E''<sub>2</sub> that separately contain the kinetic energy of each body: 
:<math>
\begin{align}
E_1 & = \frac{\mu}{m_1}E = {1 \over 2} m_1 \dot{\mathbf{x}}_1^2 + \frac{\mu}{m_1} U(\mathbf{r}) \\[4pt]
E_2 & = \frac{\mu}{m_2}E = {1 \over 2} m_2 \dot{\mathbf{x}}_2^2 + \frac{\mu}{m_2} U(\mathbf{r}) \\[4pt]
E_\text{tot} & = E_1 + E_2
\end{align}
</math>

== Central forces ==
{{main|Classical central-force problem}}

For many physical problems, the force '''F'''('''r''') is a [[central force]], i.e., it is of the form

:<math>\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = F(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}}</math>
where ''r'' = |'''r'''| and '''r^''' = '''r'''/''r'' is the corresponding [[unit vector]]. We now have:

:<math>
\mu \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = {F}(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}} \ ,
</math>

where ''F''(''r'') is negative in the case of an attractive force.
