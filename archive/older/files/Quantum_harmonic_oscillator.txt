The '''quantum harmonic oscillator''' is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] analog of the [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]].   Because an arbitrary [[Potential energy|potential]] can usually be approximated as a [[Harmonic oscillator#Simple harmonic oscillator|harmonic potential]] at the vicinity of a stable [[equilibrium point]],  it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics.

==One-dimensional harmonic oscillator==

===Hamiltonian and energy eigenstates===
[[Image:HarmOsziFunktionen.png|thumb|Wavefunction representations for the first eight bound eigenstates, ''n'' = 0 to 7. The horizontal axis shows the position ''x''. Note: The graphs are not normalized, and the signs of some of the functions differ from those given in the text.]]
[[Image:Aufenthaltswahrscheinlichkeit harmonischer Oszillator.png|thumb|Corresponding probability densities.]]

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the particle is:
:<math>\hat H = \frac{{\hat p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} k {\hat x}^2 = \frac{{\hat p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 {\hat x}^2\, ,</math>
where {{mvar|m}} is the particle's mass, {{mvar|k}} is the force constant, <math>\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the oscillator, <math>\hat{x}</math>  is the [[position operator]] (given by {{mvar|x}}), and   <math>\hat{p}</math>  is the [[momentum operator]] (given by <math>\hat p = - i \hbar {\partial \over \partial x} \,</math>).  The first term in the Hamiltonian represents the kinetic energy of the particle, and the second term represents its potential energy, as in [[Hooke's law]].

One may write the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]],
::<math> \hat H \left| \psi \right\rangle = E \left| \psi \right\rangle  ~,</math>
where {{mvar|E}} denotes a to-be-determined real number that will specify a time-independent [[energy level]], or [[eigenvalue]], and the solution  {{math|{{!}}''?''?}} denotes that level's energy [[eigenstate]].

One may solve the differential equation representing this eigenvalue problem in the coordinate basis, for the [[wave function]] {{math|?''x''{{!}}''?''? {{=}} ''?''(''x'')}}, using a [[spectral method]]. It turns out that there is a family of solutions. In this basis, they amount to [[Hermite polynomials#Hermite functions| Hermite functions]],
:<math>  \psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n\,n!}} \cdot \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \cdot e^{
- \frac{m\omega x^2}{2 \hbar}} \cdot H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}} x \right), \qquad n = 0,1,2,\ldots. </math>

The functions ''H<sub>n</sub>'' are the physicists' [[Hermite polynomials]],
:<math>H_n(z)=(-1)^n~ e^{z^2}\frac{d^n}{dz^n}\left(e^{-z^2}\right).</math>

The corresponding energy levels are
:<math> E_n = \hbar \omega \left(n + {1\over 2}\right)=(2 n + 1) {\hbar \over 2} \omega~.</math>

This energy spectrum is noteworthy for three reasons.  First, the energies are quantized, meaning that only discrete energy values (integer-plus-half multiples of {{math|''h?''}}) are possible; this is a general feature of quantum-mechanical systems when a particle is confined.  Second, these discrete energy levels are equally spaced, unlike in the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, or the [[particle in a box]].  Third, the lowest achievable energy (the energy of the {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}} state, called the [[ground state]]) is not equal to the minimum of the potential well, but {{math|''h?''/2}} above it; this is called [[zero-point energy]]. Because of the zero-point energy, the position and momentum of the oscillator in the ground state are not fixed (as they would be in a classical oscillator), but have a small range of variance, in accordance with the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].  

The ground state probability density is concentrated at the origin, which means the particle spends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well, as one would expect for a state with little energy. As the energy increases, the probability density  peaks at the classical "turning points", where the state's energy coincides with the potential energy. (See the discussion below of the highly excited states.) This is consistent with the classical harmonic oscillator, in which the particle spends more of its time (and is therefore more likely to be found) near the turning points, where it is moving the slowest. The [[correspondence principle]] is thus satisfied. Moreover, special nondispersive [[wave packet]]s, with minimum uncertainty,  called [[Coherent states#The wavefunction of a coherent state|coherent states]] oscillate very much like classical objects, as illustrated in the figure; they are ''not'' eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

===Ladder operator method===
[[Image:QHarmonicOscillator.png|right|thumb|Probability densities <nowiki>|</nowiki>''?<sub>n</sub>''(''x'')<nowiki>|</nowiki><sup>2</sup> <!--or in pseudoTeX: <math>\left |\psi_n(x)\right |^2</math> --> for the bound eigenstates, beginning with the ground state (''n'' = 0) at the bottom and increasing in energy toward the top. The horizontal axis shows the position {{mvar|x,}} and brighter colors represent higher probability densities.]]

The "[[ladder operator]]" method, developed by [[Paul Dirac]], allows extraction of the energy eigenvalues without directly solving the differential equation. It is generalizable to more complicated problems, notably in [[quantum field theory]].  Following this approach, we define the operators {{mvar|a}} and its [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] {{math|''a''<sup>†</sup>}},
:<math>\begin{align}
          a &=\sqrt{m\omega \over 2\hbar} \left(\hat x + {i \over m \omega} \hat p \right) \\
  a^\dagger &=\sqrt{m\omega \over 2\hbar} \left(\hat x - {i \over m \omega} \hat p \right)
\end{align}</math>

This leads to the useful representation of <math>\hat{x}</math> and  <math>\hat{p}</math>,
:<math>\begin{align}
  \hat x &=  \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}\frac{1}{m\omega}}(a^\dagger + a) \\
  \hat p &= i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}m\omega}(a^\dagger - a) ~.
\end{align}</math>

The operator {{mvar|a}} is not [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]], since itself and its adjoint {{math|''a''<sup>†</sup>}} are not equal. The energy eigenstates {{math|{{ket|''n''}}}}, when operated on by these ladder operators, give
:<math>\begin{align}
  a^\dagger|n\rangle &= \sqrt{n + 1} | n + 1\rangle \\
          a|n\rangle &= \sqrt{n} | n - 1\rangle.
\end{align}</math>

It is then evident that {{math|''a''<sup>†</sup>}}, in essence, appends a single quantum of energy to the oscillator, while {{mvar|a}} removes a quantum. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as "creation" and "annihilation" operators.

From the relations above, we can also define a number operator {{mvar|N}}, which has the following property:
:<math>\begin{align}
                        N &= a^\dagger a \\
  N\left| n \right\rangle &= n\left| n \right\rangle.
\end{align}</math>

The following [[commutator]]s can be easily obtained by substituting the [[canonical commutation relation]],
:<math>[a, a^\dagger] = 1,\qquad[N, a^\dagger] = a^{\dagger},\qquad[N, a] = -a, </math>

And the Hamilton operator can be expressed as
:<math>\hat H = \hbar\omega\left(N + \frac{1}{2}\right),</math>

so the eigenstate of {{mvar|N}} is also the eigenstate of energy.

The commutation property yields
:<math>\begin{align}
  Na^{\dagger}|n\rangle &= \left(a^\dagger N + [N, a^\dagger]\right)|n\rangle \\
                        &= \left(a^\dagger N + a^\dagger\right)|n\rangle \\
                        &= (n + 1)a^\dagger|n\rangle,
\end{align} </math>

and similarly,
:<math>Na|n\rangle = (n - 1)a | n \rangle.</math>

This means that {{mvar|a}} acts on  {{math|{{!}}''n''?}}  to produce, up to a multiplicative constant,   {{math|{{!}}''n''–1?}}, and {{math|''a''<sup>†</sup>}} acts on   {{math|{{!}}''n''?}} to produce {{math|{{!}}''n''+1?}}. For this reason, {{mvar|a}} is called a '''annihilation operator''' ("lowering operator"), and {{math|''a''<sup>†</sup>}} a '''creation operator''' ("raising operator"). The two operators together are called [[ladder operator]]s. In quantum field theory, {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''<sup>†</sup>}} are alternatively called "annihilation" and "creation" operators because they destroy and create particles, which correspond to our quanta of energy.

Given any energy eigenstate, we can act on it with the lowering operator, {{mvar|a}}, to produce another eigenstate with {{math|''h?''}} less energy. By repeated application of the lowering operator, it seems that we can produce energy eigenstates down to {{math|''E'' {{=}} -8}}. However, since
:<math>n = \langle n | N | n \rangle = \langle n | a^\dagger a | n \rangle = \Bigl(a | n \rangle \Bigr)^\dagger a | n \rangle \geqslant 0,</math>

the smallest eigen-number is 0, and
:<math>a \left| 0 \right\rangle = 0. </math>

In this case, subsequent applications of the lowering operator will just produce zero kets, instead of additional energy eigenstates. Furthermore, we have shown above that
:<math>\hat H \left|0\right\rangle = \frac{\hbar\omega}{2} \left|0\right\rangle</math>

Finally, by acting on  |0? with the raising operator and multiplying by suitable normalization factors, we can produce an infinite set of energy eigenstates 
:<math>\left\{\left| 0 \right\rangle, \left| 1 \right\rangle, \left| 2 \right\rangle, \ldots , \left| n \right\rangle, \ldots\right\},</math>

such that

:<math>\hat H \left| n \right\rangle = \hbar\omega \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \left| n \right\rangle, </math>

which matches the energy spectrum given in the preceding section.

Arbitrary eigenstates can be expressed in terms of |0?,

:<math>|n\rangle = \frac{(a^\dagger)^n}{\sqrt{n!}} |0\rangle. </math>
:Proof:
::<math>\begin{align}
   \langle n | aa^\dagger | n \rangle &= \langle n|\left([a, a^\dagger] + a^\dagger a\right)| n \rangle = \langle n|(N + 1)|n\rangle = n + 1 \\
     \Rightarrow a^\dagger | n\rangle &= \sqrt{n + 1} | n + 1\rangle \\
                    \Rightarrow|n\rangle &= \frac{a^\dagger}{\sqrt{n}} | n - 1 \rangle = \frac{(a^\dagger)^2}{\sqrt{n(n - 1)}} | n - 2 \rangle = \cdots = \frac{(a^\dagger)^n}{\sqrt{n!}}|0\rangle.
\end{align}</math>

===Analytical questions===

The preceding analysis is algebraic, using only the commutation relations between the raising and lowering operators. Once the algebraic analysis is complete, one should turn to analytical questions. First, one should find the ground state, that is, the solution of the equation <math>a\psi_0 = 0</math>. In the position representation, this is the first-order differential equation
:<math>\left(x+\frac{\hbar}{m\omega}\frac{d}{dx}\right)\psi_0=0</math>,
whose solution is easily found to be the Gaussian<ref> 
The normalization constant is <math>C = \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}</math>, and satisfies the normalization condition 
<math>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi_0(x)^{*}\psi_0(x) = 1</math>.</ref>
:<math>\psi_0(x)=Ce^{-\frac{m\omega x^2}{2\hbar}}</math>.
Conceptually, it is important that there is only one solution of this equation; if there were, say, two linearly independent ground states, we would get two independent chains of eigenvectors for the harmonic oscillator. Once the ground state is computed, one can show inductively that the excited states are Hermite polynomials times the Gaussian ground state, using the explicit form of the raising operator in the position representation. One can also prove that, as expected from the uniqueness of the ground state, the energy eigenstates <math>\psi_n</math> constructed by the ladder method form a ''complete'' orthonormal set of functions.<ref>See Theorem 11.4 in {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Quantum Theory for Mathematicians|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=267|isbn=978-1461471158 |publisher=Springer|year=2013}}</ref>

Explicitly connecting with the previous section, the ground state  |0?  in the position representation is determined by <math> a| 0\rangle =0</math>,  
:<math>  \left\langle x \mid a \mid 0 \right\rangle = 0 \qquad
  \Rightarrow \left(x + \frac{\hbar}{m\omega}\frac{d}{dx}\right)\left\langle x\mid 0\right\rangle = 0 \qquad
  \Rightarrow           </math>        
:<math>                                \left\langle x\mid 0\right\rangle = \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar}\right)^\frac{1}{4} \exp\left( -\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}x^2 \right) 
                                                                                                      = \psi_0  ~,</math>
hence
:<math> \langle x \mid a^\dagger \mid 0 \rangle = \psi_1 (x) ~,</math>
so that <math>\psi_1(x,t)=\langle x \mid e^{-3i\omega t/2} a^\dagger \mid 0 \rangle </math>, and so on.

===Natural length and energy scales===
The quantum harmonic oscillator possesses natural scales for length and energy, which can be used to simplify the problem. These can be found by [[nondimensionalization#Quantum harmonic oscillator|nondimensionalization]].

The result is that, if   ''energy'' is measured in units of  {{math|''h?''}} and ''distance'' in units of {{math|{{sqrt|''h''/(''m?'')}}}}, then the Hamiltonian  simplifies to
::<math> H = -\frac{1}{2} {d^2 \over dx^2} +\frac{1}{2}  x^2 ,</math>
while the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues simplify to Hermite functions and integers offset by a half,
::<math>\psi_n(x)= \left\langle x \mid n \right\rangle = {1 \over \sqrt{2^n n!}}~ \pi^{-1/4} \exp(-x^2 / 2)~ H_n(x),</math>
::<math>E_n = n + \tfrac{1}{2} ~,</math>
where {{math|''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}} are the [[Hermite polynomials]].

To avoid confusion,  these "natural units"   will mostly not be adopted in this article. However, they frequently come in handy when performing calculations, by bypassing clutter.

For example, the [[fundamental solution]] ([[Propagator#Basic_examples:_propagator_of_free_particle_and_harmonic_oscillator|propagator]]) of {{math|''H-i?<sub>t</sub>''}}, the time-dependent Schrödinger operator for this oscillator, simply boils down to the [[Mehler kernel]],<ref>[[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli, W.]]  (2000), ''Wave Mechanics: Volume 5 of Pauli Lectures on Physics'' (Dover Books on Physics). {{ISBN|978-0486414621}} ; Section 44.</ref><ref>[[Edward Condon|Condon, E. U.]]  (1937). "Immersion of the Fourier transform in a continuous group of functional transformations", ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA''  '''23''', 158–164. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1076889/pdf/pnas01779-0028.pdf online]</ref>
::<math>\langle x \mid \exp (-itH) \mid y \rangle \equiv K(x,y;t)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi i \sin t}} \exp \left(\frac{i}{2\sin t}\left ((x^2+y^2)\cos t - 2xy\right )\right )~,</math>
where {{math| ''K''(''x'',''y'';0) {{=}}''d''(''x'' - ''y'')}}. The most general solution for a given initial configuration {{math|''?''(''x'',0)}} then is simply
::<math>\psi(x,t)=\int dy~ K(x,y;t) \psi(y,0) ~.</math>
{{see also|Path integral formulation#Simple harmonic oscillator}}

===Highly excited states===
[[File:Excited_state_for_quantum_harmonic_oscillator.svg|thumb|Excited state with ''n''=30, with the vertical lines indicating the turning points]]
When {{mvar|n}} is large, the eigenstates are  localized into the classical allowed region, that is, the region in which a classical particle with energy {{math|''E''<sub>''n''</sub>}} can move. The eigenstates are peaked near the turning points: the points at the ends of the classically allowed region where the classical particle changes direction. This phenomenon can be verified  through [[Hermite_polynomials#Asymptotic_expansion|asymptotics of the Hermite polynomials]],  and also through the [[WKB approximation]]. 

The frequency of oscillation at {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the momentum {{math|''p''(''x'')}} of a classical particle of energy {{math|''E''<sub>''n''</sub>}}  and position {{mvar|x}}.  Furthermore, the square of the amplitude (determining the probability density) is ''inversely'' proportional to  {{math|''p''(''x'')}},  reflecting the  length of time the classical particle spends near {{mvar|x}}.   The system behavior in a small neighborhood of the turning point does not have a simple classical explanation, but can be modeled using an [[Airy function]]. Using properties of the Airy function,  one may estimate the probability of finding the particle outside the classically allowed region,  to be approximately 
:<math>\frac{2}{n^{1/3}3^{2/3}\Gamma^2(\tfrac{1}{3})}=\frac{1}{n^{1/3}\cdot  7.46408092658...}</math>
This is also given, asymptotically, by the integral 
:<math>\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{(2n+1)\left (x-\tfrac{1}{2}\sinh(2x)  \right )}dx ~.</math>

===Phase space solutions===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, solutions to the quantum harmonic oscillator in [[quasiprobability distribution#Fock state|several different representations]] of the [[quasiprobability distribution]] can be written in closed form.  The most widely used of these is for the [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution]], which has the solution
:<math>F_n(u) = \frac{(-1)^n}{\pi \hbar} L_n\left(4\frac{u}{\hbar \omega}\right) e^{-2u/\hbar \omega} ~,</math>
where
:<math>u=\frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \frac{p^2}{2m}</math>,
and ''L<sub>n</sub>'' are the [[Laguerre polynomials]].

This example illustrates how the Hermite  and Laguerre polynomials are [[Hermite polynomials#Wigner distributions of Hermite functions|linked]] through the [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Wigner map]].

Meanwhile, the [[Husimi_Q_representation|Husimi Q function]] of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates have an even simpler form. If we work in the natural units described above, we have
:<math>Q(\psi_n)(x,p)=\frac{(x^2+p^2)^n}{n!}\frac{e^{-(x^2+p^2)}}{\pi}</math>
This claim can be verified using the [[Segal–Bargmann_space#The_Segal.E2.80.93Bargmann_transform|Segal–Bargmann transform]]. Specifically, since the [[Segal–Bargmann_space#The_canonical_commutation_relations|raising operator in the Segal–Bargmann representation]] is simply multiplication by <math>z=x+ip</math> and the ground state is the constant function 1, the normalized harmonic oscillator states in this representation are simply <math>z^n/\sqrt{n!}</math> . At this point, we can appeal to the formula for the Husimi Q function in terms of the Segal–Bargmann transform.

==''N''-dimensional harmonic oscillator==
The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is readily generalizable to ''N'' dimensions, where ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;... . In one dimension, the position of the particle was specified by a single [[coordinate system|coordinate]], ''x''. In ''N'' dimensions, this is replaced by ''N'' position coordinates, which we label ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>. Corresponding to each position coordinate is a momentum; we label these ''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''N''</sub>. The [[canonical commutation relations]] between these operators are

:<math>
\begin{align}
{[}x_i , p_j{]} &= i\hbar\delta_{i,j} \\
{[}x_i , x_j{]} &= 0                  \\
{[}p_i , p_j{]} &= 0
\end{align}
</math>

The Hamiltonian for this system is

:<math> H = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( {p_i^2 \over 2m} + {1\over 2} m \omega^2 x_i^2 \right).</math>

As the form of this Hamiltonian makes clear, the ''N''-dimensional harmonic oscillator is exactly analogous to ''N'' independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators with the same mass and spring constant. In this case, the quantities ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> would refer to the positions of each of the ''N'' particles. This is a convenient property of the <math>r^2</math> potential, which allows the potential energy to be separated into terms depending on one coordinate each.

This observation makes the solution straightforward. For a particular set of quantum numbers {''n''} the energy eigenfunctions for the ''N''-dimensional oscillator are expressed in terms of the 1-dimensional eigenfunctions as:

:<math>
\langle \mathbf{x}|\psi_{\{n\}}\rangle
=\prod_{i=1}^N\langle x_i\mid \psi_{n_i}\rangle
</math>

In the ladder operator method, we define ''N'' sets of ladder operators,

:<math>\begin{align}
a_i &= \sqrt{m\omega \over 2\hbar} \left(x_i + {i \over m \omega} p_i \right), \\
a^{\dagger}_i &= \sqrt{m \omega \over 2\hbar} \left( x_i - {i \over m \omega} p_i \right).
\end{align}</math>

By an analogous procedure to the one-dimensional case, we can then show that each of the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''a''<sup>†</sup><sub>''i''</sub> operators lower and raise the energy by ?? respectively. The Hamiltonian is
:<math>
H =  \hbar \omega \, \sum_{i=1}^N \left(a_i^\dagger \,a_i + \frac{1}{2}\right).
</math>
This Hamiltonian is invariant under the dynamic symmetry group ''U''(''N'') (the unitary group in ''N'' dimensions), defined by

:<math>
U\, a_i^\dagger \,U^\dagger = \sum_{j=1}^N  a_j^\dagger\,U_{ji}\quad\text{for all}\quad
U \in U(N),
</math>
where <math>U_{ji}</math> is an element in the defining matrix representation of ''U''(''N'').

The energy levels of the system are

:<math> E = \hbar \omega \left[(n_1 + \cdots + n_N) + {N\over 2}\right].</math>
:<math>n_i = 0, 1, 2, \dots \quad (\text{the energy level in dimension } i).
</math>

As in the one-dimensional case, the energy is quantized. The ground state energy is ''N'' times the one-dimensional ground energy, as we would expect using the analogy to ''N'' independent one-dimensional oscillators. There is one further difference: in the one-dimensional case, each energy level corresponds to a unique quantum state. In ''N''-dimensions, except for the ground state, the energy levels are ''degenerate'', meaning there are several states with the same energy.

The degeneracy can be calculated relatively easily.  As an example, consider the 3-dimensional case: Define ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sub>3</sub>. All states with the same ''n'' will have the same energy.  For a given ''n'', we choose a particular ''n''<sub>1</sub>. Then ''n''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''<sub>1</sub>.   There are ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 possible pairs {''n''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''n''<sub>3</sub>}.  ''n''<sub>2</sub> can take on the values 0 to ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''<sub>1</sub>, and for each ''n''<sub>2</sub> the value of ''n''<sub>3</sub> is fixed. The degree of degeneracy therefore is:

:<math>
g_n = \sum_{n_1=0}^n n - n_1 + 1 = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
</math>
Formula for general ''N'' and ''n'' [''g''<sub>''n''</sub> being the dimension of the symmetric irreducible ''n''<sup>th</sup> power representation of the unitary group ''U''(''N'')]:
:<math>
g_n = \binom{N+n-1}{n}
</math>
The special case ''N'' = 3, given above, follows directly from this general equation.  This is however, only true for distinguishable particles, or one particle in N dimensions (as dimensions are distinguishable). For the case of ''N'' bosons in a one-dimension harmonic trap, the degeneracy scales as the number of ways to partition an integer ''n'' using integers less than or equal to ''N''.

:<math>
g_n = p(N_{-},n)
</math>

This arises due to the constraint of putting ''N'' quanta into a state ket where <math>\sum_{k=0}^\infty k n_k = n  </math>   and <math> \sum_{k=0}^\infty  n_k = N </math>, which are the same constraints as in integer partition.

===Example: 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator===
[[File:2D_Spherical_Harmonic_Orbitals.png|thumb|300px|right|Schrödinger 3D Spherical Harmonic orbital solutions in 2D Density plots with Mathematica(TM) generating source code snippet at the top]]
The Schrödinger equation of a spherically-symmetric three-dimensional harmonic oscillator can be solved explicitly by separation of variables; see [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential#3D isotropic harmonic oscillator|this article]] for the present case. This procedure is analogous to the separation performed in the [[Hydrogen-like atom#Schrödinger equation in a spherically symmetric potential|hydrogen-like atom]] problem, but with the [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential|spherically symmetric potential]]
:<math>V(r) = {1\over 2} \mu \omega^2 r^2,</math>
where {{mvar|µ}} is the mass of the problem. (Because {{mvar|m}} will be used below for the magnetic quantum number, mass is indicated by  {{mvar|µ}},  instead of  {{mvar|m}},   as earlier in this article.)

The solution reads<ref> [[Albert Messiah]], ''Quantum Mechanics'', 1967, North-Holland, Ch XII, ?§ 15, p 456.[https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanicsVolumeI/page/n239 online]</ref>
:<math>\psi_{klm}(r,\theta,\phi) = N_{kl} r^{l}e^{-\nu r^2}L_k^{(l+{1\over 2})}(2\nu r^2) Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)</math>
where
:<math>N_{kl}=\sqrt{\sqrt{\frac{2\nu^3}{\pi }}\frac{2^{k+2l+3}\;k!\;\nu^l}{

:<math>{L_k}^{(l+{1\over 2})}(2\nu r^2)</math> 
are [[Laguerre polynomials#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomials]]; The order {{mvar|k}}  of the polynomial is a non-negative integer;
:<math>Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\,</math> is a [[spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic function]];
: {{mvar| h}} is the reduced [[Planck constant]]: &nbsp; <math>\hbar\equiv\frac{h}{2\pi}~.</math>

The energy eigenvalue is
:<math>E=\hbar \omega \left(2k+l+\frac{3}{2}\right) ~.</math>
The energy is usually described by the single [[quantum number]]
:<math>n\equiv 2k+l  ~.</math>

Because {{mvar|k}} is a non-negative integer, for every even {{mvar|n}} we have {{math|l {{=}} 0, 2, ..., ''n'' - 2, ''n''}} and for every odd {{mvar|n}}  we have {{math|l {{=}} 1, 3, ..., ''n''&nbsp;-&nbsp;2, ''n''}} . The magnetic quantum number {{mvar|m}} is an integer satisfying {{math|-l = ''m'' = l}},    so for every {{mvar|n}} and l  there are 2''l''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 different [[quantum state]]s, labeled by {{mvar|m}} . Thus, the degeneracy at level {{mvar|n}}   is
:<math>\sum_{l=\ldots,n-2,n} (2l+1) = {(n+1)(n+2)\over 2} ~,</math>
where the sum starts from 0 or 1, according to whether {{mvar|n}} is even or odd.
This result is in accordance with the dimension formula above, and amounts to the dimensionality of a symmetric representation of {{math|''SU''(3)}},<ref>Fradkin, D. M. "Three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator and SU3." ''American Journal of Physics'' '''33''' (3) (1965) 207-211.</ref> the relevant degeneracy group.

==Harmonic oscillators lattice: phonons==
{{see also|Canonical quantization}}

We can extend the notion of a harmonic oscillator to a one lattice of many particles. Consider a one-dimensional quantum mechanical ''harmonic chain'' of ''N'' identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, and we will see how [[phonon]]s arise from it. The formalism that we will develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.

As in the previous section, we denote the positions of the masses by  {{math|''x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,...''}}, as measured from their equilibrium positions (i.e.  {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}}  = 0  if the particle {{mvar| i}} is at its equilibrium position.) In two or more dimensions, the {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} are vector quantities. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for this system is

:<math>\mathbf{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N {p_i^2 \over 2m} + {1\over 2} m \omega^2 \sum_{\{ij\} (nn)} (x_i - x_j)^2 ~,</math>
where {{mvar|m}} is the (assumed uniform) mass of each atom, and  {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} and  {{math|''p<sub>i</sub>''}} are the position and [[momentum]] operators for the ''i'' th atom and the sum is made over the nearest neighbors (nn).  However, it is customary to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of the [[normal modes]] of the [[wavevector]] rather than in terms of the particle coordinates so that one can work in the more convenient [[Fourier space]].

We introduce, then, a set of {{mvar|N}} "normal coordinates" {{math|''Q<sub>k</sub>''}}, defined as the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s of the {{mvar|x}}s, and {{mvar|N}} "conjugate momenta"  {{mvar|?}} defined as the Fourier transforms of the {{mvar|p}}s,
:<math>
Q_k = {1\over\sqrt{N}} \sum_{l} e^{ikal} x_l</math>
:<math>
\Pi_{k} = {1\over\sqrt{N}} \sum_{l}  e^{-ikal} p_l    ~.
</math>

The quantity {{math|''k<sub>n</sub>''}} will turn out to be the [[Wavenumber|wave number]] of the phonon, i.e. 2''p''  divided by the [[wavelength]]. It takes on quantized values, because the number of atoms is finite.

This preserves the desired commutation relations in either real space or wave vector space
: <math> \begin{align} 
\left[x_l , p_m \right]&=i\hbar\delta_{l,m} \\ 
\left[ Q_k , \Pi_{k'} \right] &={1\over N} \sum_{l,m} e^{ikal} e^{-ik'am}  [x_l , p_m ] \\
 &= {i \hbar\over N} \sum_{m} e^{iam(k-k')} = i\hbar\delta_{k,k'} \\
\left[ Q_k , Q_{k'} \right] &= \left[ \Pi_k , \Pi_{k'} \right] = 0 ~.
\end{align}</math>

From the general result
: <math> \begin{align} 
\sum_{l}x_l x_{l+m}&={1\over N}\sum_{kk'}Q_k Q_{k'}\sum_{l} e^{ial\left(k+k'\right)}e^{iamk'}= \sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}e^{iamk} \\ 
\sum_{l}{p_l}^2 &= \sum_{k}\Pi_k \Pi_{-k}   ~,
\end{align}</math>
it is easy to show, through elementary trigonometry, that the potential energy term is
: <math> 
{1\over 2} m \omega^2 \sum_{j} (x_j - x_{j+1})^2= {1\over 2} m \omega^2\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}(2-e^{ika}-e^{-ika})= {1\over 2} m \sum_{k}{\omega_k}^2Q_k Q_{-k} ~ ,</math>
where
:<math>\omega_k = \sqrt{2 \omega^2 (1 - \cos(ka))} ~.</math>

The Hamiltonian may be written in wave vector space as
:<math>\mathbf{H} = {1\over {2m}}\sum_k \left(
{ \Pi_k\Pi_{-k} } + m^2 \omega_k^2 Q_k Q_{-k} 
\right) ~.</math>

Note that the couplings between the position variables have been transformed away; if the {{mvar|Q}}s and {{mvar| ?}}s were [[Hermitian operator|hermitian]](which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe {{mvar|N}} ''uncoupled'' harmonic oscillators.

The form of the quantization depends on the choice of boundary conditions; for simplicity, we impose ''periodic'' boundary conditions, defining the {{math|(''N'' + 1)}}th atom as equivalent to the first atom. Physically, this corresponds to joining the chain at its ends. The resulting quantization is

:<math>k=k_n = {2n\pi \over Na}
\quad \hbox{for}\ n = 0, \pm1, \pm2, \ldots , \pm {N \over 2}.\ </math>

The upper bound to {{mvar|n}} comes from the minimum wavelength, which is twice the lattice spacing {{mvar|a}}, as discussed above.

The  harmonic oscillator eigenvalues or energy levels for the mode {{math|''?<sub>k</sub>''}} are 
::<math>E_n = \left({1\over2}+n\right)\hbar\omega_k   \quad\hbox{for}\quad n=0,1,2,3,\ldots</math>

If we ignore the [[zero-point energy|zero-point]] energy then the levels are evenly spaced at 
::<math>\hbar\omega,\, 2\hbar\omega,\, 3\hbar\omega,\, \ldots  </math>

So an '''exact''' amount of [[energy]] {{math|  ''h?''}},  must be supplied to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push it to the next energy level. In comparison to the [[photon]] case when the [[electromagnetic field]] is quantised, the quantum of vibrational energy is called a [[phonon]].

All quantum systems show wave-like and particle-like properties. The particle-like properties of the phonon are best understood using the methods of [[second quantization]] and operator techniques described later.<ref name="Mahan">{{cite book|last=Mahan|first=GD|authorlink=|title=many particle physics|publisher= springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0306463389|year=1981}}</ref>

In the continuum limit, ''a''?0, ''N''?8, while ''Na'' is held fixed. The canonical coordinates ''Q<sub>k</sub>'' devolve to the decoupled momentum modes of a scalar field, <math>\phi_k</math>, whilst the location index {{mvar|i}} (''not the displacement dynamical  variable'') becomes the ''parameter {{mvar|x}} argument of the scalar field, <math>\phi (x,t)</math>.
