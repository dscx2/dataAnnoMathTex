{{Cosmology}}

In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the '''cosmological constant''' (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter [[lambda]]: Λ) is the energy density of space, or [[vacuum energy]], that arises in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. It is closely associated to the concepts of [[dark energy]] and [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].<ref name="CC Definition" />

Einstein originally introduced the concept in 1917<ref>{{harvp|Einstein|1917}}</ref> to counterbalance the effects of gravity and achieve a [[static universe]], a notion which was the accepted view at the time. Einstein abandoned the concept in 1931 after [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery of the expanding universe.<ref name="Rugh 2001 3"/> From the 1930s until the late 1990s, most physicists assumed the cosmological constant to be equal to zero.<ref name="Λ = 0?"/> That changed with the surprising discovery in 1998 that the [[accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion of the universe is accelerating]], implying the possibility of a positive nonzero value for the cosmological constant.<ref name="1998 Discovery"/>

Since the 1990s, studies have shown that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to so-called [[dark energy]].<ref>{{harvp|Redd|2013}}</ref> The cosmological constant Λ is the simplest possible explanation for dark energy, and is used in the current standard model of cosmology known as the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]]. While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps not at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

According to [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) which underlies modern [[particle physics]], empty space is defined by the [[vacuum state]] which is a collection of [[quantum fields]]. All these quantum fields exhibit fluctuations in their [[ground state]] (lowest energy density) arising from the [[zero-point energy]] present everywhere in space. These zero-point fluctuations should act as a contribution to the cosmological constant Λ, but when calculations are performed these fluctuations give rise to an enormous vacuum energy.<ref>{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=1}}</ref> The discrepancy between theorized vacuum energy from QFT and observed vacuum energy from cosmology is a source of major contention, with the values predicted exceeding observation by some 120&nbsp;orders of magnitude, a discrepancy that has been called "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!".<ref name="CC Problem"/> This issue is called the [[cosmological constant problem]] and it is one of the greatest mysteries in science with many physicists believing that "the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature".<ref name="CC Problem 3"/>

== History ==
[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] included the cosmological constant as a term in his [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] for [[general relativity]] because he was dissatisfied that otherwise his equations did not allow, apparently, for a [[static universe]]: gravity would cause a universe that was initially at dynamic equilibrium to contract. To counteract this possibility, Einstein added the cosmological constant.<ref name="Rugh 2001 3"/> However, soon after Einstein developed his static theory, observations by [[Edwin Hubble]] indicated that the universe appears to be expanding; this was consistent with a cosmological solution to the ''original'' general relativity equations that had been found by the mathematician [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann|Friedmann]], working on the Einstein equations of general relativity. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to accept the validation of his equations—when they had predicted the expansion of the universe in theory, before it was demonstrated in observation of the cosmological [[redshift]]—as his "biggest blunder".<ref name="Biggest Blunder"/>

In fact, adding the cosmological constant to Einstein's equations does not lead to a static universe at equilibrium because the [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases [[vacuum energy]], which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe that contracts slightly will continue contracting.<ref>{{harvp|Ryden|2003|p=59}}</ref>

However, the cosmological constant remained a subject of theoretical and empirical interest. Empirically, the onslaught of cosmological data in the past decades strongly suggests that our universe has a positive cosmological constant.<ref name="1998 Discovery"/>  The explanation of this small but positive value is an outstanding theoretical challenge, the so-called [[cosmological constant problem]].

Some early generalizations of Einstein's gravitational theory, known as [[classical unified field theories]], either introduced a cosmological constant on theoretical grounds or found that it arose naturally from the mathematics. For example, Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] claimed that the cosmological constant version of the vacuum field equation expressed the "[[epistemology|epistemological]]" property that the universe is "self-[[gauge theory|gauging]]", and [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s pure-[[affine connection|affine]] theory using a simple [[History of variational principles in physics|variational principle]] produced the field equation with a cosmological term.

According to current theories of physics, dark energy now dominates as the largest source of energy of the universe, in contrast to earlier epochs when it was insignificant.]]
{{Technical|section|date=March 2014}}
The cosmological constant <math>\Lambda</math> appears in [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equation]] in the form

:<math>R_{\mu \nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu},</math>

where the Ricci tensor/scalar [[Ricci tensor|''R'']] and the metric tensor [[metric tensor (general relativity)|''g'']] describe the structure of [[spacetime]], the [[stress–energy tensor]] ''T'' describes the energy and momentum density and flux of the matter in that point in spacetime, and  the universal constants [[gravitational constant|''G'']] and [[speed of light|''c'']] are conversion factors that arise from using traditional units of measurement. When ''Λ'' is zero, this reduces to the field equation of general relativity usually used in the mid-20th&nbsp;century. When ''T'' is zero, the field equation describes empty space (the [[vacuum]]).

The cosmological constant has the same effect as an intrinsic [[energy density]] of the vacuum, ''ρ''<sub>vac</sub> (and an associated [[pressure]]). In this context, it is commonly moved onto the right-hand side of the equation, and defined with a [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] factor of 8''π'': {{nowrap|1=Λ = 8''πρ''<sub>vac</sub>}}, where unit conventions of general relativity are used (otherwise factors of ''G'' and ''c'' would also appear, i.e. {{nowrap|1=Λ = 8''π''(''G''/''c''<sup>2</sup>)''ρ''<sub>vac</sub> = ''κρ''<sub>vac</sub>}}, where ''κ'' is [[Einstein's constant]]). It is common to quote values of energy density directly, though still using the name "cosmological constant", with [[Planck units#Gravity|convention]] {{nowrap|1=8''πG'' = 1}}. The true dimension of Λ is a length<sup>−2</sup>.

Given the Planck (2018) values of Ω<sub>Λ</sub> = {{val|0.6889|0.0056}} and ''H''<sub>0</sub> = {{val|67.66|0.42|u=(km/s)/Mpc}} = {{val|2.1927664|0.0136|e=-18|u=s-1}}, Λ has the value of

:<math> \Lambda = 1.1056 \times 10^{-52}\, \text{m}^{-2},</math><ref>Λ is evaluated as {{nowrap|3 (''H''<sub>0</sub>/''c'')<sup>2</sup> Ω<sub>Λ</sub>}}.</ref>

or {{val|2.888|e=-122}} in Planck units or {{val|4.33|e=-66}} eV<sup>2</sup> in natural units.

A positive vacuum energy density resulting from a cosmological constant implies a negative pressure, and vice versa. If the energy density is positive, the associated negative pressure will drive an accelerated expansion of the universe, as observed. (See [[dark energy]] and [[cosmic inflation]] for details.)

===Ω<sub>Λ</sub> (Omega Lambda)===
Instead of the cosmological constant itself, cosmologists often refer to the ratio between the energy density due to the cosmological constant and the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] of the universe, the tipping point for a sufficient density to stop the universe from expanding forever. This ratio is usually denoted Ω<sub>Λ</sub>, and is estimated to be {{val|0.6889|0.0056}}, according to results published by the [[Planck Collaboration]] in 2018.<ref>{{harvp|Planck Collaboration|2018}}</ref>

In a flat universe, Ω<sub>Λ</sub> is the fraction of the energy of the universe due to the cosmological constant, i.e., what we would intuitively call the fraction of the universe that is made up of dark energy. Note that this value changes over time: the critical density changes with [[cosmological time]], but the energy density due to the cosmological constant remains unchanged throughout the history of the universe: the amount of dark energy increases as the universe grows, while the amount of matter does not.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Equation of state===
Another ratio that is used by scientists is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]], usually denoted ''w'', which is the ratio of pressure that dark energy puts on the universe to the energy per unit volume.<ref>{{harvp|Brumfiel|2007|p=246}}</ref> This ratio is {{nowrap|''w'' {{=}} &minus;1}} for a true cosmological constant, and is generally different for alternative time-varying forms of vacuum energy such as [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. The Planck Collaboration (2018) has measured ''w'' = {{val|-1.028|0.032}}, consistent with {{val|-1}}, assuming no evolution in ''w'' over cosmic time.

==Positive value==

Observations announced in 1998 of distance–redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]]<ref name="1998 Discovery"/> indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. When combined with measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] these implied a value of Ω<sub>Λ</sub> ≈ 0.7,<ref>See e.g. {{harvp|Baker et al.|1999}}</ref> a result which has been supported and refined by more recent measurements.<ref>See for example Table 9 in {{harvp|The Planck Collaboration|2015a|p=27}}</ref> There are other possible causes of an [[accelerating universe]], such as [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], but the cosmological constant is in most respects the [[Occam's razor|simplest solution]]. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], includes the cosmological constant, which is measured to be on the order of 10<sup>−52&nbsp;</sup>m<sup>−2</sup>, in metric units.  It is often expressed as 10<sup>−35&nbsp;</sup>s<sup>−2</sup> (by multiplication with c<sup>2</sup>, i.e. ≈10<sup>17</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>) or as 10<sup>−122</sup><ref>{{harvp|Barrow|Shaw|2011}}</ref> (by multiplication with square Planck length, i.e. ≈10<sup>-70</sup> m<sup>2</sup>) in other unit systems. The value is based on recent measurements of vacuum energy density, <math> \rho_\text{vacuum} = 5.96 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/m}^3</math>,<ref>Calculated based on the Hubble constant and <math>\Omega_\Lambda</math> from {{harvp|The Planck Collaboration|2015b}}</ref> or 10<sup>−47</sup>&nbsp;GeV<sup>4</sup>, or 5.96 10<sup>−30</sup>&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> in other unit systems.

As was only recently seen, by works of [[Gerardus 't Hooft|'t Hooft]], [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]] and others, a positive cosmological constant has surprising consequences, such as a finite maximum [[entropy]] of the observable universe (see the [[holographic principle]]).<ref>{{harvp|Dyson|Kleban|Susskind|2002}}</ref>

==Predictions==

===<span id="Cosmological constant problem"> Quantum field theory </span>===
{{see also|Cosmological constant problem}}
{{unsolved|physics|Why does the [[zero-point energy]] of the quantum vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?}}
A major outstanding [[Unsolved problems in physics|problem]] is that most [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict a huge value for the [[quantum fluctuation|quantum vacuum]]. A common assumption is that the [[quantum fluctuation|quantum vacuum]] is equivalent to the cosmological constant. Although no theory exists that supports this assumption, arguments can be made in its favor.<ref>{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=?}}</ref>

Such arguments are usually based on [[dimensional analysis]] and [[effective field theory]]. If the universe is described by an effective local quantum field theory down to the [[Planck scale]], then we would expect a cosmological constant of the order of <math>M_{\rm pl}^2</math> (<math>6\times 10^{54}\, \text{eV}^2</math> in natural unit or <math>1</math> in reduced Planck unit). As noted above, the measured cosmological constant is smaller than this by a factor of ~10<sup>−120</sup>. This discrepancy has been called "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!".<ref name="CC Problem"/>

Some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which further complicates things. This is the [[cosmological constant problem]], the worst problem of [[fine-tuning]] in [[physics]]: there is no known natural way to derive the tiny cosmological constant used in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] from [[particle physics]].

===Anthropic principle===
One possible explanation for the small but non-zero value was noted by [[Steven Weinberg]] in 1987 following the [[anthropic principle]].<ref>{{harvp|Weinberg|1987}}</ref> Weinberg explains that if the vacuum energy took different values in different domains of the universe, then observers would necessarily measure values similar to that which is observed: the formation of life-supporting structures would be suppressed in domains where the vacuum energy is much larger. Specifically, if the vacuum energy is negative and its absolute value is substantially larger than it appears to be in the observed universe (say, a factor of 10 larger), holding all other variables (e.g. matter density) constant, that would mean that the universe is closed; furthermore, its lifetime would be shorter than the age of our universe, possibly too short for intelligent life to form. On the other hand, a universe with a large positive cosmological constant would expand too fast, preventing galaxy formation. According to Weinberg, domains where the vacuum energy is compatible with life would be comparatively rare. Using this argument, Weinberg predicted that the cosmological constant would have a value of less than a hundred times the currently accepted value.<ref>{{harvp|Vilenkin|2006|pages=138–9}}</ref> In 1992, Weinberg refined this prediction of the cosmological constant to 5 to 10 times the matter density.<ref>{{harvp|Weinberg|1992|p=182}}</ref>

This argument depends on a lack of a variation of the distribution (spatial or otherwise) in the vacuum energy density, as would be expected if dark energy were the cosmological constant. There is no evidence that the vacuum energy does vary, but it may be the case if, for example, the vacuum energy is (even in part) the potential of a scalar field such as the residual [[inflaton]] (also see [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]). Another theoretical approach that deals with the issue is that of [[multiverse]] theories, which predict a large number of "parallel" universes with different laws of physics and/or values of fundamental constants. Again, the anthropic principle states that we can only live in one of the universes that is compatible with some form of intelligent life. Critics claim that these theories, when used as an explanation for fine-tuning, commit the [[inverse gambler's fallacy]].

In 1995, Weinberg's argument was refined by [[Alexander Vilenkin]] to predict a value for the cosmological constant that was only ten times the matter density,<ref>{{harvp|Vilenkin|2006|page=146}}</ref> i.e. about three times the current value since determined.

===Failure to detect dark energy===
An attempt to directly observe dark energy in a laboratory failed to detect a new force.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=D. O. Sabulsky |author2=I. Dutta |author3=E. A. Hinds |author4=B.
