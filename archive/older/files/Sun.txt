The Sun is a [[G-type main-sequence star]] (G2V) based on its [[stellar classification|spectral class]]. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a [[yellow dwarf]] (its light is closer to white than yellow).

Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|became the Solar System]]. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated [[nuclear fusion]] in its [[solar core|core]]. It is thought that almost all stars [[Star formation|form by this process]].

The Sun currently [[nuclear fusion|fuses]] about 600 million tons of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] every second, [[mass-energy equivalence|converting 4 million tons of matter into energy]] every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When [[hydrogen fusion]] in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a [[red giant]]. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], and render [[Earth]] uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a [[white dwarf]], and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.

The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since [[prehistoric times]], and the Sun has been [[The Sun in culture|regarded by some cultures]] as a [[solar deity|deity]]. The [[Synodic day|synodic]] rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of [[solar calendar]]s, one of which is the predominant [[calendar]] in use today.

==Name and etymology==
The [[English language|English]] proper name ''Sun'' developed from [[Old English]] ''sunne'' and may be related to ''south''. Cognates to English ''sun'' appear in other [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old Frisian]] ''sunne'', ''sonne'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sunna'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''sonne'', modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zon'', [[Old High German]] ''sunna'', modern German ''Sonne'', [[Old Norse]] ''sunna'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''sunnō''. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''sunnōn''.<ref name=BARNHART776>

The [[Latin]] name for the Sun, ''Sol'', is not commonly used in everyday English. ''Sol'' is also used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a [[solar day]] on another planet, such as [[Mars]].<ref>

The English weekday name ''[[Sunday]]'' stems from Old English (''Sunnandæg''; "Sun's day", from before 700) and is ultimately a result of a [[Interpretatio germanica|Germanic interpretation]] of Latin ''dies solis'', itself a translation of the Greek ἡμέρα ἡλίου (''hēméra hēlíou'').<ref name="BARNHART778">

Since the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. Within the core, the proportion of helium has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere towards the center of the Sun because of [[gravity]]. The proportions of metals (heavier elements) is unchanged. [[Heat transfer|Heat is transferred]] outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see [[#Radiative zone|Radiative zone]] below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core<ref name=hkt2004_9.2.3>{{Cite book |last=Hansen |first=C.J. |last2=Kawaler |first2=S.A. |last3=Trimble |first3=V. |title=Stellar Interiors: Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution |pages=§ 9.2.3 |nopp=yes |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20089-7}}</ref>  and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the [[metallicity]] is only 84% of what it was in the [[Protostar|protostellar]] phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the [[main sequence]] and become a [[red giant]].<ref>Iben, I Jnr (1965) "Stellar Evolution.

==Structure and fusion==
{{Main|Standard solar model}}
[[File:Sun poster.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|The structure of the Sun]]
The structure of the Sun contains the following layers:

:*'''Core''' – the innermost 20-25% of the Sun's radius, where temperature (energies) and pressure are sufficient for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Hydrogen fuses into helium (which cannot currently be fused at this point in the Sun's life). The fusion process releases energy, and the helium gradually accumulates to form an inner core of helium within the core itself.
:* '''Radiative zone''' – [[Convection]] cannot occur until much nearer the surface of the Sun. Therefore, between about 20-25% of the radius, and 70% of the radius, there is a "radiative zone" in which energy transfer occurs by means of radiation (photons) rather than by convection.
:* '''Tachocline''' – the boundary region between the radiative and convective zones.
:* '''Convective zone''' – Between about 70% of the Sun's radius and a point close to the visible surface, the Sun is cool and diffuse enough for convection to occur, and this becomes the primary means of outward heat transfer, similar to weather cells which form in the earth's atmosphere.
:* '''Photosphere''' – the deepest part of the Sun which we can directly observe with visible light. Because the Sun is a gaseous object, it does not have a clearly-defined surface; its visible parts are usually divided into a 'photosphere' and 'atmosphere'.
:* '''Atmosphere''' – a gaseous 'halo' surrounding the Sun, comprising the [[chromosphere]], [[solar transition region]], [[corona]] and [[heliosphere]]. These can be seen when the main part of the Sun is hidden, for example, during a [[solar eclipse]].

The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and [[thermal expansion|expand]] slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.<ref>

===Tachocline===
{{main|Tachocline}}

The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the [[tachocline]]. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large [[shear (fluid)|shear]] between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.<ref>

===Convective zone===
{{main|Convection zone}}
The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000&nbsp;km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into [[thermal|thermal cells]] that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m<sup>3</sup> (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).<ref name=NASA1/>

The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance  called the [[granule (solar physics)|solar granulation]] at the smallest scale and [[supergranulation]] at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains "small-scale" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.<ref name=NASA1/> The Sun's thermal columns are [[Bénard cells]] and take the shape of hexagonal prisms.<ref>

{{Main|Photosphere}}
The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] to visible light.<ref name=Abhyankar1977/> Photons produced in this layer escape the sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight.  The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of [[Hydrogen anion|H<sup>−</sup> ions]], which absorb visible light easily.<ref name=Abhyankar1977/> Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with [[hydrogen]] atoms to produce H<sup>−</sup> ions.<ref name="Gibson">

The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or ''limb'' of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as [[limb darkening]].<ref name=Abhyankar1977/> The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a [[black-body]] radiating at 5,777 [[kelvin|K]], interspersed with atomic [[absorption line]]s from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>−3</sup> (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of [[Earth's atmosphere]] at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.<ref>

During early studies of the [[optical spectrum]] of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any [[chemical element]]s then known on Earth. In 1868, [[Norman Lockyer]] hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed ''[[helium]]'', after the Greek Sun god [[Helios]]. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.<ref name="Lockyer">

===Photons and neutrinos===
{{see also|Solar irradiance}}

High-energy [[gamma ray|gamma-ray]] photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000&nbsp;years.<ref name="NASA">
{{cite web |date=2007 |title=Ancient sunlight |url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php |website=Technology Through Time |publisher=NASA |issue=50 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |ref=harv}}</ref> In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the [[neutrino]]s, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.<ref>
{{Cite journal |last=Stix |first=M. |date=2003 |title=On the time scale of energy transport in the sun |journal=[[Solar Physics (journal)|Solar Physics]] |volume=212 |issue=1 |pages=3–6 |bibcode=2003SoPh..212....3S |doi=10.1023/A:1022952621810}}</ref>

Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were [[Solar neutrino problem|lower than theories predicted]] by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of [[neutrino oscillation]]: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the [[theory]], but neutrino detectors were missing {{frac|2|3}} of them because the neutrinos had changed [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] by the time they were detected.<ref name="Schlattl">

The Sun has a [[magnetic field]] that varies across the surface of the Sun. Its polar field is {{convert|1|-|2|G|sigfig=1|lk=on}}, whereas the field is typically {{convert|3000|G|sigfig=1}} in features on the Sun called [[sunspot]]s and {{convert|10|-|100|G|sigfig=1}} in [[solar prominence]]s.<ref name= nssdc />

The magnetic field also varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year [[solar cycle]] is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.<ref name="doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012" /><ref name="Zirker2002-119">{{Cite book |last=Zirker |first=J.B. |date=2002 |title=Journey from the Center of the Sun |pages=119–120 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-05781-1}}</ref><ref name="Lang">{{Cite book |last=Lang |first=Kenneth R. |date=2008 |title=The Sun from Space |page=75 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-540-76952-1}}</ref>

Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's [[photosphere]], and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the [[convection|convective transport]] of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical [[solar minimum]], few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its [[solar maximum|maximum]], sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as [[Spörer's law]]. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.<ref name="Sunspot2001">

An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year [[Babcock Model|Babcock]]–Leighton [[solar dynamo|dynamo]] cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between [[toroidal and poloidal]] solar magnetic fields. At [[solar maximum|solar-cycle maximum]], the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal [[Toroidal and poloidal|toroidal]] quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=G.E. |last2=Ellerman |first2=F. |last3=Nicholson |first3=S.B. |last4=Joy |first4=A.H. |title=The Magnetic Polarity of Sun-Spots |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=49 |page=153 |year=1919 |doi=10.1086/142452 |bibcode=1919ApJ....49..153H}}</ref><ref name="solarcycle">

During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At [[solar minimum|solar-cycle minimum]], the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.<ref>

The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].<ref name=Russell2001/> In an approximation known as ideal [[magnetohydrodynamics]], plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin [[heliospheric current sheet|current sheet]] is formed in the solar wind.<ref name=Russell2001/> At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an [[Archimedean spiral]] structure called the [[Parker spiral]].<ref name=Russell2001/> The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|μT]] (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1&nbsp;nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5&nbsp;nT, about a hundred&nbsp;times greater.<ref name=Wang2003>

===Variation in activity===
[[File:Solar-cycle-data.png|thumb|right|Measurements from 2005 of solar cycle variation during the last 30 years]]

The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called [[solar variation|solar activity]]. [[Solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections|coronal-mass ejections]] tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of [[solar wind]] are emitted from [[coronal holes]] at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and [[interplanetary magnetic field]] outward into the Solar System.<ref name=Zirker2002>

==Life phases==
{{Main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Stellar evolution}}

The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life. It has not changed dramatically for over four billion<ref group=lower-alpha name=short /> years, and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally.

===Formation===
The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant [[molecular cloud]] that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.<!-- We would say 4.57, but there may be uncertainty; for example, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05847.pdf seems to suggest 4.587 rather than 4.567 --><ref name=Zirker2002-7>

Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nuclear fusion]].

[[HD 162826]] and [[HD 186302]] are hypothesized stellar siblings of the Sun, having formed in the same molecular cloud.

The Sun is about halfway through its [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million [[tonne]]s of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing [[neutrino]]s and [[solar radiation]]. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years as a main-sequence star.<ref>

The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the [[inverse-square law]]. This stronger force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/evolution.html |title=The Sun's Evolution}}</ref> At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/01/earth-wont-die-soon-thought |title=Earth Won't Die as Soon as Thought |date=22 January 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Sun red giant.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The size of the current Sun (now in the [[main sequence]]) compared to its estimated size during its red-giant phase in the future]]
The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a [[supernova]]. Instead it will exit the [[main sequence]] in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a [[red giant]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Nola Taylor Redd |title=Red Giant Stars: Facts, Definition & the Future of the Sun |url=http://www.space.com/22471-red-giant-stars.html |website=space.com |accessdate=20 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=schroder>{{Cite journal |last1=Schröder |first1=K.-P. |last2=Connon Smith |first2=R. |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13022.x |title=Distant future of the Sun and Earth revisited |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=386 |issue=1 |pages=155–163 |year=2008 |pmid= |pmc= |arxiv=0801.4031 |bibcode=2008MNRAS.386..155S}}</ref> As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.<ref name=schroder /><ref name=sackmann>{{Cite journal |last1=Boothroyd |first1=A.I. |last2=Sackmann |first2=I.‐J. |doi=10.1086/306546 |title=The CNO Isotopes: Deep Circulation in Red Giants and First and Second Dredge‐up |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=510 |issue=1 |pages=232–250 |year=1999 |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode=1999ApJ...510..232B |arxiv=astro-ph/9512121}}</ref>

Even before it becomes a red giant, the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a [[subgiant]] phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous. This then starts the [[red giant branch|red-giant-branch]] phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.<ref name=schroder/>

[[File:Evolution of a Sun-like star.svg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Evolution of a Sun-like star. The track of a one solar mass star on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] is shown from the main sequence to the post-asymptotic-giant-branch stage.]]
After the red-giant branch the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core, full of [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] helium ignites violently in the [[helium flash]], where it is estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the [[triple-alpha process]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html |title=The End Of The Sun}}</ref> The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the [[red clump]] or [[horizontal branch]], but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core.<ref name=schroder/>

When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and [[thermal pulse]]s that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU.<ref name=agb>{{Cite journal |last1=Vassiliadis |first1=E. |last2=Wood |first2=P.R. |doi=10.1086/173033 |title=Evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars to the end of the asymptotic giant branch with mass loss |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=413 |page=641 |year=1993 |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode=1993ApJ...413..641V}}</ref> According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to [[tidal forces]] (and, eventually, drag from the lower [[chromosphere]]), so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.<ref name=schroder/> For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a [[planetary nebula]]. By the end of that phase—lasting approximately 500,000 years—the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.

The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a [[planetary nebula]] as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K. The final naked core, a [[white dwarf]], will have a temperature of over 100,000 K, and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present day mass.<ref name=schroder/> The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical [[black dwarf]].<ref name=bloecker1>{{bibcode|1995A&A...297..727B}}</ref><ref name=bloecker2>{{bibcode|1995A&A...299..755B}}</ref>

The Sun's orbit around the Milky Way is perturbed due to the non-uniform mass distribution in Milky Way, such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms.

===Faint young Sun problem===
{{Main|Faint young Sun paradox}}

Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the [[Archean|Archean eon]], the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]]) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of [[solar energy]] reaching it.<ref name="Kasting">
{{Cite journal |last=Kasting |first=J.F. |last2=Ackerman |first2=T.P. |title=Climatic Consequences of Very High Carbon Dioxide Levels in the Earth's Early Atmosphere |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=234 |issue=4782 |pages=1383–1385 |date=1986 |doi=10.1126/science.11539665 |pmid=11539665 |ref=harv |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230890}}</ref>

However, examination of Archaean sediments appears inconsistent with the hypothesis of high greenhouse concentrations. Instead, the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface [[albedo]] brought about by less continental area and the "lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei". This would have led to increased absorption of solar energy, thereby compensating for the lower solar output.<ref name = "Rosing">{{cite journal |author1=Rosing, Minik T. |author2=Bird, Dennis K. |author3=Sleep, Norman H. |author4=Bjerrum, Christian J. |title=No climate paradox under the faint early Sun |journal=Nature |volume=464 |issue=7289 |pages=744–747 |date=1 April 2010 |pmid=20360739 |doi=10.1038/nature08955 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..744R}}</ref>

==Observational history==

The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since [[prehistoric times]], and the Sun has been [[solar deity|regarded by some cultures]] as a [[deity]].

The sculpture is probably from around 1350 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. It is displayed at the [[National Museum of Denmark]].]]
{{See also|The Sun in culture}}
The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] entity. [[Sun worship|Worship of the Sun]] was central to civilizations such as the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Inca]] of South America and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. In religions such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]]; [[Mnajdra]], [[Malta]] and at [[Stonehenge]], [[England]]); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chichén Itzá]] in [[Mexico]] is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es.

The Egyptians portrayed the god [[Ra]] as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was [[Helios]], carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of [[Elagabalus]] in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|late Roman Empire]] the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally "Unconquered Sun") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven [[classical planets|planets]] (Greek ''planetes'', "wanderer"); the naming of the [[Names of the days of the week|days of the weeks]] after the seven planets dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]].<ref name=oed>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/planet |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Planet |accessdate=22 March 2015 |date=December 2007}}</ref><ref name=almagest>{{Cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena : the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=1997 |pages=1–12 |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/002182869702800101}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author=Ptolemy |last2=Toomer |first2=G.J. |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-691-00260-6}}</ref>

===Development of scientific understanding===

In the early first millennium BC, [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] observed that the Sun's motion along the [[ecliptic]] is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of [[Earth]] in an [[elliptic orbit]] around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]] and moving slower when it is farther away at [[Apsis|aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Babylon to Voyager and beyond: a history of planetary astronomy |first=David |last=Leverington |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-80840-8 |pages=6–7 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]]. He reasoned that it was not the [[chariot]] of [[Helios]], but instead a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] and that the [[Moon]] reflected the light of the Sun.<ref>

[[Eratosthenes]] estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the 3rd century BC as "of stadia [[myriad]]s 400 and 80000", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (755,000&nbsp;km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the 1st century AD, [[Ptolemy]] estimated the distance as 1,210 times [[Earth radius|the radius of Earth]], approximately {{convert|{{#expr:1.210*6.371round2}}|e6km|AU|sp=us}}.<ref>

The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (see [[Heliocentrism]]). This view was developed in a more detailed [[mathematical model]] of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].

Observations of sunspots were recorded during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC–AD 220) by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]], who maintained records of these observations for centuries. [[Averroes]] also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.<ref>

The first satellites designed for long term observation of the Sun from interplanetary space were [[NASA]]'s [[Pioneer program|Pioneers]] 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field.

In the 1970s, two [[Helios probes|Helios]] spacecraft and the [[Skylab]] [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona.

In 1980, the [[Solar Maximum Mission]] was launched by [[NASA]]. This spacecraft was designed to observe [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s and [[Ultraviolet|UV]] radiation from [[solar flare]]s during a time of high solar activity and [[Sun#External links|solar luminosity]]. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] mission [[STS-41C]] retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entering]] Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.<ref>

Launched in 1991, Japan's [[Yohkoh]] (''Sunbeam'') satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an [[solar eclipse|annular eclipse]] in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.<ref>

All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The [[Ulysses probe]] was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to [[Jupiter]], to "slingshot" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750&nbsp;km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref>

Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood.

[[Herschel wedge]]s, also called Solar Diagonals, are effective and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.<ref name=Macdonald>{{cite book |last=Macdonald |first=Lee |date=2012 |title=How to Observe the Sun Safely |publisher=Springer Science + Business Media |place=New York |chapter=2.

Partial [[solar eclipse]]s are hazardous to view because the eye's [[pupil]] is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view, ''not'' by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the [[Moon]] passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same [[surface brightness]] as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2&nbsp;mm to ~6&nbsp;mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer.<ref name="Espenak">

An [[optical phenomenon]], known as a [[green flash]], can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being [[refraction|bent]] (usually through a [[temperature inversion]]) towards the observer.

[[Ultraviolet]] light from the Sun has [[antiseptic]] properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. It also causes [[sunburn]], and has other biological effects such as the production of [[vitamin D]] and [[sun tanning]].

It was adopted as the [[Sabbath]] day by Christians who did not have a Jewish background. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the [[winter solstice]] (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun ([[Sol Invictus]]). Christian churches were built with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the East.<ref>{{cite book |author=Owen Chadwick |title=A History of Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qugouOh3KjMC&pg=PA22 |year=1998 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=22 |isbn=978-0-312-18723-1}}</ref>
