In everyday use and in [[kinematics]], the '''speed''' of an object is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the change of its [[Position (vector)|position]]; it is thus a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J.

Speed has the [[dimensional analysis|dimension]]s of distance divided by time. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of speed is the [[metre per second]], but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the [[kilometre per hour]] or, in the US and the UK, [[miles per hour]]. For air and marine travel the [[Knot (unit)|knot]] is commonly used.

The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to [[special relativity]], is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum ''c'' = {{val|299792458}} metres per second (approximately {{val|1079000000|u=km/h}} or {{val|671000000|u=mph}}). [[Matter]] cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of [[rapidity]] replaces the classical idea of speed.

==Definition==

=== Historical definition ===
Italian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time.<ref name="Hewitt 2006, p. 42">Hewitt (2006), p. 42</ref> In equation form, that is

:<math>v = \frac{d}{t},</math>

where <math>v</math> is speed, <math>d</math> is distance, and <math>t</math> is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50&nbsp;km/h, slow to 0&nbsp;km/h, and then reach 30&nbsp;km/h).

===Instantaneous speed===
Speed at some instant, or assumed constant during a [[infinitesimal|very short]] period of time, is called ''instantaneous speed''. By looking at a [[speedometer]], one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant.<ref name="Hewitt 2006, p. 42"/> A car travelling at 50&nbsp;km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50&nbsp;km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25&nbsp;km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833&nbsp;m.

In mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed <math>v</math> is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous [[velocity]] <math>\boldsymbol{v}</math>, that is, the [[derivative]] of the position <math>\boldsymbol{r}</math> with respect to [[time]]:<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=113-01-33|title=IEC 60050 - Details for IEV number 113-01-33: "speed"|last=|first=|date=|website=Electropedia: The World's Online Electrotechnical Vocabulary|access-date=2017-06-08}}</ref>
:<math>v = \left|\boldsymbol v\right| = \left|\dot {\boldsymbol r}\right| = \left|\frac{d\boldsymbol r}{dt}\right|\,.</math>

If <math>s</math> is the length of the path (also known as the distance) travelled until time <math>t</math>, the speed equals the time derivative of <math>s</math>:<ref name=":0" />
:<math>v = \frac{ds}{dt}.</math>

In the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to <math>v=s/t</math>.  The average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration.

===Average speed===

Different from instantaneous speed, ''average speed'' is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).

Average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed.<ref name="Hewitt 2006, p. 42" /> If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to

:<math>d = \boldsymbol{\bar{v}}t\,.</math>

Using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.

Expressed in graphical language, the [[slope]] of a [[tangent line]] at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a [[chord (geometry)|chord line]] of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord. Average speed of an object is
Vav = s÷t

===Difference between speed and velocity===
Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas [[velocity]] describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs|year=1901|pages=125|hdl=2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=149}} This is the likely origin of the speed/velocity terminology in vector physics.</ref> If a car is said to travel at 60&nbsp;km/h, its ''speed'' has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60&nbsp;km/h to the north, its ''velocity'' has now been specified.

The big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a [[circle]]. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average ''velocity'' is zero, but its average ''speed'' is found by dividing the [[circumference]] of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average ''velocity'' is calculated by considering only the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] between the starting and end points, whereas the average ''speed'' considers only the total [[distance]] travelled.

===Tangential speed===
{{Classical mechanics|rotational}}
Linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time, while '''tangential speed''' (or tangential velocity) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path.<ref name="Hewitt 2006, p. 131">Hewitt (2006), p. 131</ref> A point on the outside edge of a [[merry-go-round]] or [[turntable]] travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center. Travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed, and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as ''tangential speed'' because the direction of motion is [[Tangent lines to circles|tangent]] to the [[circumference]] of the circle. For circular motion, the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably, and both use units of m/s, km/h, and others.

[[Rotational speed]] (or ''angular speed'') involves the number of revolutions per unit of time. All parts of a rigid merry-go-round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time. Thus, all parts share the same rate of rotation, or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time. It is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute (RPM) or in terms of the number of "radians" turned in a unit of time. There are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation (2{{pi}} radians exactly). When a direction is assigned to rotational speed, it is known as rotational velocity or [[angular velocity]]. Rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed.

Tangential speed and rotational speed are related: the greater the RPMs, the larger the speed in metres per second. Tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation.<ref name="Hewitt 2006, p. 131"/> However, tangential speed, unlike rotational speed, depends on radial distance (the distance from the axis). For a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed, the tangential speed in the centre is zero. Towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis.<ref>Hewitt (2006), p. 132</ref> In equation form:

:<math>v \propto \!\, r \omega\,,</math>

where ''v'' is tangential speed and ω (Greek letter [[omega]]) is rotational speed. One moves faster if the rate of rotation increases (a larger value for ω), and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs (a larger value for ''r''). Move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast. Move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed. In any kind of rotating system, tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation.

When proper units are used for tangential speed ''v'', rotational speed ω, and radial distance ''r'', the direct proportion of ''v'' to both ''r'' and ω becomes the exact equation

:<math>v = r\omega\,.</math>

Thus, tangential speed will be directly proportional to ''r'' when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand.

==Psychology==
According to [[Jean Piaget]], the intuition for the notion of speed in humans precedes that of duration, and is based on the notion of outdistancing.<ref>Jean Piaget, ''Psychology and Epistemology: Towards a Theory of Knowledge'', The Viking Press, pp. 82–83 and pp. 110–112, 1973.
