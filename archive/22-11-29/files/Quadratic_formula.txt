In [[elementary algebra]], the '''quadratic formula''' is a formula that provides the solution(s) to a [[quadratic equation]]. There are other ways of solving a quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as [[Factorization|factoring]] (direct factoring, grouping, [[Factorization#Quadratic ac method|AC method]]), [[completing the square]], [[Graph of a function|graphing]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/quadratic-factorisation/|title=Quadratic Factorisation: The Complete Guide|date=2016-03-13|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>

Given a general quadratic equation of the form

:<math>ax^2+bx+c=0</math>

with {{Math|''x''}} representing an unknown, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} representing [[Constant term|constant]]s with {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}, the quadratic formula is:

:<math display="block">x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ \ </math>

where the [[plus-minus sign|plus-minus symbol "±"]] indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sterling|first=Mary Jane|title=Algebra I For Dummies|year=2010|publisher=Wiley Publishing|isbn=978-0-470-55964-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2toggaqJMzEC&q=quadratic+formula&pg=PA219|page=219}}</ref> Written separately, they become:

:<math> x_1=\frac{-b + \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\quad\text{and}\quad x_2=\frac{-b - \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}</math>

Each of these two solutions is also called a [[Zero of a function|root (or zero)]] of the quadratic equation. Geometrically, these roots represent the {{math|''x''}}-values at which ''any'' [[parabola]], explicitly given as {{math|1=''y'' = ''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c''}}, crosses the {{Math|''x''}}-axis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-functions-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-formula-a1/a/quadratic-formula-explained-article|title=Understanding the quadratic formula|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>

As well as being a formula that yields the zeros of any parabola, the quadratic formula can also be used to identify the axis of symmetry of the parabola,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/axis-of-symmetry.php|title=Axis of Symmetry of a Parabola. How to find axis from equation or from a graph.

==Equivalent formulations==
The quadratic formula may also be written as

:<math>x = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} \ \ ,</math>

which may be simplified to

:<math>x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{c}{a}} \ \ .</math>

The expression inside the square root is called the [[discriminant]].<br />
This version of the formula makes it easy to find the roots when using a calculator. <br />
The version above is also convenient when complex roots are involved, in which case the expression outside the square root is the real part and the square root expression is the imaginary part:

:<math>x = -\frac{\ b}{2a} \pm i\sqrt{ \Big | \left(\frac{\ b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{c}{a} \Big |} \ \ .</math>

===Muller's method===
A lesser known quadratic formula, which is used in [[Muller's method]] and which can be found from [[Vieta's formulas]], provides the same roots via the equation:

:<math>x=\frac{-2c}{b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}} = \frac{2c}{-b \mp \sqrt {b^2-4ac\ }}\ \ .</math>

===Formulations based on alternative parametrizations===
The standard parametrization of the quadratic equation is 
:<math>ax^2+bx+c=0\ \ .</math>

Some sources, particularly older ones, use alternative parameterizations of the quadratic equation such as 
: <math>ax^2 - 2b_1 x + c = 0</math>, where <math>b_1 = -b/2</math>,<ref name="kahan">{{Citation |first=Willian |last=Kahan |title=On the Cost of Floating-Point Computation Without Extra-Precise Arithmetic |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Qdrtcs.pdf |date=November 20, 2004 |access-date=2012-12-25}}</ref>
or 
: <math>ax^2 + 2b_2 x + c = 0</math>, where <math>b_2 = b/2</math>.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Quadratic_Formula |title=Quadratic Formula |journal=Proof Wiki |access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref>

These alternative parametrizations result in slightly different forms for the solution, but which are otherwise equivalent to the standard parametrization.

=={{anchor|Other derivations}} Derivations of the formula==
Many different methods to derive the quadratic formula are available in the literature. The standard one is a simple application of the [[completing the square]] technique.<ref>{{citation

Co., 1986).</ref> Alternative methods are sometimes simpler than completing the square, and may offer interesting insight into other areas of mathematics.

===By using the 'completing the square' technique===
====Standard method====
Divide the quadratic equation by <math>a</math>, which is allowed because <math>a</math> is non-zero:

:<math>x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x + \frac{c}{a}=0\ \ .</math>

Subtract {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} from both sides of the equation, yielding:
:<math>x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x= -\frac{c}{a}\ \ .</math>

The quadratic equation is now in a form to which the method of [[completing the square]] is applicable. In fact, by adding a constant to both sides of the equation such that the left hand side becomes a complete square, the quadratic equation becomes:

:<math>x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 =-\frac{c}{a}+\left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2\ \ ,</math>

which produces:

:<math>\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=-\frac{c}{a}+\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\ \ .</math>

Accordingly, after rearranging the terms on the right hand side to have a common denominator, we obtain:

:<math>\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\ \ .</math>

The square has thus been completed. Taking the [[square root]] of both sides yields the following equation:

:<math>x+\frac{b}{2a}=\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}\ \ .</math>

In which case, isolating the <math>x</math> would give the quadratic formula:

:<math>x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}\ \ .</math>

There are many alternatives of this derivation with minor differences, mostly concerning the manipulation of <math>a</math>.

====Method 2====
The majority of algebra texts published over the last several decades teach [[completing the square]] using the sequence presented earlier:

# Divide each side by <math>a</math> to make the polynomial [[Monic polynomial|monic]].
# Rearrange.
# Add <math>\textstyle \left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2</math> to both sides to complete the square.
# Rearrange the terms in the right side to have a common denominator.
# Take the square root of both sides.
# Isolate ''<math>x</math>''.

Completing the square can also be accomplished by a sometimes shorter and simpler sequence:<ref name="Hoehn1975">{{cite journal |last=Hoehn |first=Larry |title=A More Elegant Method of Deriving the Quadratic Formula |journal=The Mathematics Teacher |year=1975 |volume=68 |issue=5 |page=442&ndash;443|doi=10.5951/MT.68.5.0442 }}</ref>

# Multiply each side by ''<math>4a</math>'',
# Rearrange.
# Add ''<math>b^2</math>'' to both sides to complete the square.
# Take the square root of both sides.
# Isolate ''<math>x</math>''.

In which case, the quadratic formula can also be derived as follows:

:<math>\begin{align}
ax^2+bx+c &= 0 \\
4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + 4ac &= 0 \\
4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx &= -4ac \\
4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + b^2 &= b^2 - 4ac \\
(2ax + b)^2 &= b^2 - 4ac \\
2ax + b &= \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\
2ax &= -b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\ 
x &= \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac }}{2a}\ \ .
\end{align}</math>

This derivation of the quadratic formula is ancient and was known in India at least as far back as 1025.<ref name=Smith1958>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David E.|title=History of Mathematics, Vol. II|year=1958|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0486204308|page=446}}</ref> Compared with the derivation in standard usage, this alternate derivation avoids fractions and squared fractions until the last step and hence does not require a rearrangement after step 3 to obtain a common denominator in the right side.<ref name=Hoehn1975/>

====Method 3====

Similar to Method 1, divide each side by ''<math>a</math>'' to make left-hand-side polynomial [[Monic polynomial|monic]] (i.e., the coefficient of ''<math>x^2</math>'' becomes ''1'').

:<math>x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x + \frac{c}{a}=0\ \ .</math>

Write the equation in a more compact and easier-to-handle format:

:<math>x^2 + Bx + C = 0</math>

where ''<math>\textstyle B = \frac{b}{a}</math>'' and ''<math>\textstyle C = \frac{c}{a}</math>''.

Complete the square by adding ''<math>\textstyle \frac{B^2}{4}</math>'' to the first two terms and subtracting it from the third term:

:<math>\left(x+\frac{B}{2}\right)^2 + \left( C - \frac{B^2}{4}\right) = 0</math>

Rearrange the left side into a [[difference of two squares]]:

:<math>\left(x+\frac{B}{2}\right)^2 - \left( \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\right)^2 = 0</math>

and factor it:

:<math>\left(x+\frac{B}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\right) \left(x+\frac{B}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\right) = 0</math>

which implies that either

:<math>x+\frac{B}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C} = 0</math>

or

:<math>x+\frac{B}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C} = 0</math>

Each of these two equations is linear and can be solved for ''<math>x</math>'', obtaining:<blockquote><math>x = -\frac{B}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C}</math>   or  <math>x = -\frac{B}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4} - C}</math></blockquote>By re-expressing ''<math>B</math>'' and ''<math>C</math>'' back into ''<math>\textstyle\frac{b}{a}</math>'' and ''<math>\textstyle\frac{c}{a}</math>'', respectively, the quadratic formula can then be obtained.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===By substitution===
Another technique is solution by [[substitution (algebra)|substitution]].<ref>Joseph J. Rotman. (2010). Advanced modern algebra (Vol. 114). American Mathematical Soc. Section 1.1</ref> In this technique, we substitute ''<math>x = y+m</math>'' into the quadratic to get:

:<math>a(y+m)^2 + b(y+m) + c =0\ \ .</math>

Expanding the result and then collecting the powers of ''<math>y</math>'' produces:

:<math>ay^2 + y(2am + b) + \left(am^2+bm+c\right) = 0\ \ .</math>

We have not yet imposed a second condition on ''<math>y</math>'' and ''<math>m</math>'', so we now choose ''<math>m</math>'' so that the middle term vanishes. That is, ''<math>2am + b = 0</math>'' or ''<math>\textstyle m = \frac{-b}{2a}</math>''. Subtracting the constant term from both sides of the equation (to move it to the right hand side) and then dividing by ''<math>a</math>'' gives:

:<math>y^2=\frac{-\left(am^2+bm+c\right)}{a}\ \ .</math>

Substituting for ''<math>m</math>'' gives:

:<math>y^2=\frac{-\left(\frac{b^2}{4a}+\frac{-b^2}{2a}+c\right)}{a}=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\ \ .</math>

Therefore,

:<math>y=\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</math>

By re-expressing ''<math>y</math>'' in terms of ''<math>x</math>'' using the formula ''<math>\textstyle x = y + m = y - \frac{b}{2a}</math>'' , the usual quadratic formula can then be obtained:

:<math>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ \ .</math>

===By using algebraic identities===
The following method was used by many historical mathematicians:<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/00207390802642237|title = The legacy of Leonhard Euler – a tricentennial tribute|year = 2009|last1 = Debnath|first1 = Lokenath|journal = International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology|volume = 40|issue = 3|pages = 353–388|s2cid = 123048345}}</ref>

Let the roots of the standard quadratic equation be {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}}. The derivation starts by recalling the identity:

:<math>(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2\ \ .</math>

Taking the square root on both sides, we get:

:<math>r_1 - r_2 = \pm\sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2}\ \ .</math>

Since the coefficient {{math|1=''a'' ≠ 0}}, we can divide the standard equation by {{math|''a''}} to obtain a quadratic polynomial having the same roots. Namely,

:<math> x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = (x - r_1)(x-r_2) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2\ \ .</math>

From this we can see that the sum of the roots of the standard quadratic equation is given by {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, and the product of those roots is given by {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}}.
<!--
We know that the sum of roots of the standard quadratic equation is given by {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}:

:<math>\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} + \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-b - b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac} - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-2b}{2a} = -\frac{b}{a}</math>\ \ .

Additionally, the product is given by {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}}:

:<math>\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \cdot \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{(-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})(-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2 - (b^2 - 4ac)}{4a^2} = \frac{4ac}{4a^2} = \frac{c}{a}\ \.</math>
-->
Hence the identity can be rewritten as:

:<math>r_1 - r_2 = \pm\sqrt{\left(-\frac{b}{a}\right)^2-4\frac{c}{a}} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{a^2} - \frac{4ac}{a^2}} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{a}\ \ .</math>

Now,

:<math>r_1 = \frac{(r_1 + r_2) + (r_1 - r_2)}{2} = \frac{-\frac{b}{a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}}{2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ \ .</math>

Since {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} −''r''{{sub|1}} − {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, if we take

:<math>r_1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</math>

then we obtain

:<math>r_2 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ \ ;</math>

and if we instead take

:<math>r_1 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</math>

then we calculate that

:<math>r_2 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ \ .</math>

Combining these results by using the standard shorthand ±, we have that the solutions of the quadratic equation are given by:

:<math> x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\ \ .</math>

===By Lagrange resolvents===
{{details|Lagrange resolvents}}
An alternative way of deriving the quadratic formula is via the method of [[Lagrange resolvents]],<ref name=Clark>Clark, A. (1984). ''Elements of abstract algebra''. Courier Corporation. p. 146.</ref> which is an early part of [[Galois theory]].<ref name="efei">{{citation

}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcp9IiZd3tQC&pg=PA134#PPA134,M1 §6.2, p. 134]</ref>
This method can be generalized to give the roots of [[cubic polynomial]]s and [[quartic polynomial]]s, and leads to Galois theory, which allows one to understand the solution of algebraic equations of any degree in terms of the [[symmetry group]] of their roots, the [[Galois group]].

This approach focuses on the ''roots'' more than on rearranging the original equation. Given a monic quadratic polynomial

:<math>x^2+px+q\ \ ,</math>

assume that it factors as

:<math>x^2+px+q=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)\ \ ,</math>

Expanding yields

:<math>x^2+px+q=x^2-(\alpha+\beta)x+\alpha \beta\ \ ,</math>

where {{math|''p'' {{=}} −(''α'' + ''β'')}} and {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''αβ''}}.

Since the order of multiplication does not matter, one can switch {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} and the values of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} will not change: one can say that {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are [[symmetric polynomials]] in {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}. In fact, they are the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] – any symmetric polynomial in {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} can be expressed in terms of {{math|''α'' + ''β''}} and {{math|''αβ''}} The Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is: given the coefficients of a polynomial, which are symmetric functions in the roots, can one "break the symmetry" and recover the roots? Thus solving a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is related to the ways of rearranging ("[[permutation|permuting]]") {{math|''n''}} terms, which is called the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''n''}} letters, and denoted {{math|''S{{sub|n}}''}}. For the quadratic polynomial, the only way to rearrange two terms is to swap them ("[[Transposition (mathematics)|transpose]]" them), and thus solving a quadratic polynomial is simple.

To find the roots {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}, consider their sum and difference:

:<math>\begin{align}
r_1 &= \alpha + \beta\\
r_2 &= \alpha - \beta\ \ .
\end{align}</math>

These are called the ''Lagrange resolvents'' of the polynomial; notice that one of these depends on the order of the roots, which is the key point. One can recover the roots from the resolvents by inverting the above equations:

:<math>\begin{align}
\alpha &= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\left(r_1+r_2\right)\\
\beta  &= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\left(r_1-r_2\right)\ \ .
\end{align}</math>

Thus, solving for the resolvents gives the original roots.

Now {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} ''α'' + ''β''}} is a symmetric function in {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}, so it can be expressed in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, and in fact {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} −''p''}} as noted above. But {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''α'' − ''β''}} is not symmetric, since switching {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} yields {{math|−''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''β'' − ''α''}} (formally, this is termed a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of the symmetric group of the roots). Since {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} is not symmetric, it cannot be expressed in terms of the coefficients {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, as these are symmetric in the roots and thus so is any polynomial expression involving them. Changing the order of the roots only changes {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} by a factor of −1, and thus the square {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''α'' − ''β''){{sup|2}}}} is symmetric in the roots, and thus expressible in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Using the equation

:<math>(\alpha - \beta)^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 4\alpha\beta\ \ </math>

yields

:<math>r_2^2 = p^2 - 4q\ \ </math>

and thus

:<math>r_2 = \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\ \ </math>

If one takes the positive root, breaking symmetry, one obtains:

:<math>\begin{align}
r_1 &= -p\\
r_2 &= \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}
\end{align}</math>
and thus
:<math>\begin{align}
\alpha &= \tfrac12\left(-p+\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\right)\\
\beta  &= \tfrac12\left(-p-\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\right)\ \ .
\end{align}</math>
Thus the roots are
:<math>\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\left(-p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\right)</math>
which is the quadratic formula. Substituting {{math|''p'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}, ''q'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} yields the usual form for when a quadratic is not monic. The resolvents can be recognized as {{math|{{sfrac|''r''{{sub|1}}|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|−''p''|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|−''b''|2''a''}}}} being the vertex, and {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} ''p''{{sup|2}} − 4''q''}} is the discriminant (of a monic polynomial).

A similar but more complicated method works for [[cubic equation]]s, where one has three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the "resolving polynomial") relating {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|3}}}}, which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a [[quartic equation]] ([[degree of a polynomial|degree]] 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved.<ref name=Clark/> The same method for a [[quintic equation]] yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots.

===Geometric significance===
{{quadratic_equation_graph_key_points.svg}}
In terms of coordinate geometry, a parabola is a curve whose {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}-coordinates are described by a second-degree polynomial, i.e. any equation of the form:

:<math>y =p(x) = a_2x^2 + a_1x +a_0\ \ ,</math>

where {{math|''p''}} represents the polynomial of degree 2 and {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>,}} and {{math|1=''a''<sub>2</sub> ≠ 0}} are constant coefficients whose subscripts correspond to their respective term's degree. The geometrical interpretation of the quadratic formula is that it defines the points on the {{math|''x''}}-axis where the parabola will cross the axis. Additionally, if the quadratic formula was looked at as two terms,

:<math>x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}=-\frac{b}{2a} \pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}</math>

the [[axis of symmetry]] appears as the line {{math|1=''x'' = −{{sfrac|''b''|2''a''}}}}. The other term, {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} − 4''ac''}}|2''a''}}}}, gives the distance the zeros are away from the axis of symmetry, where the plus sign represents the distance to the right, and the minus sign represents the distance to the left.

If this distance term were to decrease to zero, the value of the axis of symmetry would be the {{math|''x''}} value of the only zero, that is, there is only one possible solution to the quadratic equation. Algebraically, this means that {{math|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} − 4''ac''}} {{=}} 0}}, or simply {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} − 4''ac'' {{=}} 0}} (where the left-hand side is referred to as the ''discriminant''). This is one of three cases, where the discriminant indicates how many zeros the parabola will have. If the discriminant is positive, the distance would be non-zero, and there will be two solutions. However, there is also the case where the discriminant is less than zero, and this indicates the distance will be ''imaginary''{{snd}} or some multiple of the complex unit {{math|''i''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|−1}}}}{{snd}} and the parabola's zeros will be [[complex number]]s. The complex roots will be [[complex conjugate]]s, where the real part of the complex roots will be the value of the axis of symmetry. There will be no real values of {{math|''x''}} where the parabola crosses the {{math|''x''}}-axis.

===Dimensional analysis===
If the constants {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and/or {{math|''c''}} are not [[unitless]], then the units of {{math|''x''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, due to the requirement that {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}}}} and {{math|''bx''}} agree on their units. Furthermore, by the same logic, the units of {{math|''c''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''{{sup|2}}|''a''}}}}, which can be verified without solving for {{math|''x''}}. This can be a powerful tool for verifying that a quadratic expression of [[physical quantities]] has been set up correctly, prior to solving this.
