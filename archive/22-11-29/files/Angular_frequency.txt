In [[physics]], '''angular frequency''' ''ω'' (also referred to by the terms '''angular speed''', '''radial frequency''', '''circular frequency''', '''orbital frequency''', '''radian frequency''', and '''pulsatance''') is a scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the [[angular displacement]] per unit time (e.g., in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g., in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function.
Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the vector quantity ''[[angular velocity]]''. The term '''angular frequency vector''' <math>\vec{\omega}</math> is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity.<ref name="UP1">{{cite book

==Units==
In [[SI]] [[Units of measurement|units]], angular frequency is normally presented in [[radian]]s per [[second]], even when it does not express a rotational value. From the perspective of [[dimensional analysis]], the unit [[Hertz]] (Hz) is also correct, but in practice it is only used for ordinary frequency ''f'', and almost never for ''ω''. This convention is used to help avoid the confusion<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJhkD0LKtJEC&pg=PA145| title= Physics for scientists and engineers| first=Lawrence S.|last= Lerner|page=145| isbn=978-0-86720-479-7| date=1996-01-01}}</ref> that arises when dealing with frequency or the Planck constant because the units of angular measure (cycle or radian) are omitted in SI.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mohr | first1 = J.

In [[digital signal processing]], the angular frequency may be normalized by the [[sampling rate]], yielding the [[normalized frequency (digital signal processing)|normalized frequency]].

==Examples of Angular Frequency==

=== Circular Motion ===
{{main|Circular motion}}
In a rotating or orbiting object, there is a relation between distance from the axis, <math>r</math>, [[tangential speed]],<math>v</math>, and the angular frequency of the rotation. During one period, <math>T</math>, a body in circular motion travels a distance <math>vT</math>. This distance is also equal to the circumference of the path traced out by the body, <math>2\pi r</math>. Setting these two quantities equal, and recalling the link between period and angular frequency we obtain:
<math>\omega = v/r.</math>
===Oscillations of a spring===
{{Classical mechanics|rotational}}
An object attached to a spring can [[Oscillation|oscillate]]. If the spring is assumed to be ideal and massless with no damping, then the motion is [[Harmonic oscillator|simple and harmonic]] with an angular frequency given by<ref name=PoP1>{{cite book

:<math> \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, </math>

where
:''k'' is the [[spring constant]],
:''m'' is the mass of the object.

ω is referred to as the natural frequency (which can sometimes be denoted as ω<sub>0</sub>).

As the object oscillates, its acceleration can be calculated by
:<math>a = -\omega^2 x, </math>
where ''x'' is displacement from an equilibrium position.

Using "ordinary" revolutions-per-second frequency, this equation would be
:<math> a = -4 \pi^2 f^2 x. </math>

===LC circuits===
The resonant angular frequency in a series [[LC circuit]] equals the square root of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the product of the [[capacitance]] (''C'' measured in [[farad]]s) and the [[inductance]] of the circuit (''L'', with SI unit [[Henry (unit)|henry]]):<ref name=LC1>{{cite book

:<math>\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}.</math> 

Adding series resistance (for example, due to the resistance of the wire in a coil) does not change the resonant frequency of the series LC circuit. For a parallel tuned circuit, the above equation is often a useful approximation, but the resonant frequency does depend on the losses of parallel elements.

==Terminology==

Angular frequency is often loosely referred to as frequency, although in a strict sense these two quantities differ by a factor of 2{{pi}}.
